      "Delayed by 10 hrs found out accidentally after check-in when I noticed the boarding pass of the connecting flight showing 19.50 instead of 09.50 (initially thought it was a misprint). No active QF communication as they got my email and mobile number or why on earth did they not delay my flight to Dubai for 10 hours. Later I found out passengers booked under EK flight numbers were reshuffled to other EK connecting flights, passengers under Qantas had to see the QF counter in Dubai (see below). Flight service was extremely poor from FRA to Dubai, took 3 hrs to finish service, whole seat rows were forgotten to service and they could not fix this for 20 minutes (usually they do this instantly). Drinks were not delivered with the meal but well after, EK service has gone dramatically downhill. On arrival in Dubai plane was parked on roll field and we had the longest air field tour ever. It took 20 minutes in a barely air-conditioned bus with 38 degree outside temperature to arrive. Once the building was reached a big queue on incoming security check. Some passengers on tight connections got very nervous and I doubt they made it. Trying to find a QF counter at Dubai airport was a nightmare as the maze at this airport is indeed amazing. It took me 45 to get to the right concourse after 4 stops at info counters as no relevant signs exist. Some people told me it took them 2 hrs to get there from touchdown. Another 15 minutes to find the right exit and shuttle stop, just missed a shuttle to the express hotel - next one was only 30 minutes later. So from touchdown to arriving at the hotel nearby took 2.5-3 hrs and I walked about just short of 2km including all the extra steps trying to find the counter way. After 6 hrs or so I tried to make my way to the shuttle but long queue and not enough seats and full so had to push the hotel to organise quicker returns as a few groups were waiting also. At the same time the flight was pulled forward some 40 minutes so for those relying on the boarding pass time printed on the boarding pass was very tight, although it did not matter as another delay. Service on the Dubai–Sydney sector was good apart from the annoying new approach to service where everything is given separately, i.e. cutlery one pass, tablet, main meal, desert and drinks – wonder who came up with that stupid idea? This whole experience was quite amazing and makes you realise how tricky things can get and thinking about passengers who are not able to easily walk about 2 kms or do not speak English well enough to follow the maze of instructions to even get to a Qantas counter – they would have had no chance and it makes you realise how easy a connecting flight through e.g. Singapore on the same airline is.    2\n",
      "Flew Delhi-Chennai-Coimbatore in December with family. Check-in was swift and they even allowed little more luggage for our family. I had pre-booked meals and front seats. Non Veg food is served at room temperature which should be provided hot. Staff were friendly and flight was comfortable. I will definitely fly Indigo again.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     2\n",
      "Tripoli to Manchester. The plane took off an hour late - so not a great start. But once onboard there were no problems. Staff friendly food was ok - a bit too many sweets and the seats were comfortable enough. All in all an ok experience.

      "Sao Paulo - Amsterdam - London and back. Their website was very efficient and online check-in worked fine. Picked up the boarding pass at the airport via self service machine without any trouble. Boarding was efficient and quick. Plane (B777-300ER) left on time. I am not that big but leg (and knee) space was more than enough (considering it was economy). Enjoyed the IFE although I do believe the movie selection could have been better (however it changes monthly). Food was good and I must state that the fact that KLM constantly replaces the snacks on the back of the plane is very good: If you are ever thirsty or hungry you can always find a constantly renewed set of snacks and drinks at the back. I had a good short haul experience (B737-800). Leg space good and nice crew. Nice snacks were served there as well. I had the same experience on return and I must say that I considered KLM a great airline.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               2\n",

      "Flew CDG to JFK. Very effective service on the ground and onboard the plane. Food and wine were fine. Only problem was luggage delivery (30 minutes + and no priority at all despite proper yellow tag). Always the same problem with AF: they promise more than they can deliver. Furthermore as always in France no proper customers service!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              2\n",
      "Flew Sydney - Beijing - London. Both planes were old tatty and cleanliness left a lot to be desired especially the toilets. Both flights were delayed. For the second flight the scheduled time of the flight from Beijing to London was changed at the last minute. No delay was mentioned anywhere in the airport. Nothing was communicated by the airline the time just mysteriously changed from 14.30 to 16.10. When the staff were asked about it they either pretended to not speak English or just didn't. No apology was issued on the flight. The plane was sitting at the gate for hours before the flight was due to take off so no excuses there. We already had an 8 hour stopover so the extra couple of hours wasn't welcome when our total journey time was already 30+ hours. The entertainment system didn't work at all on my seat - not good for an 11 hour flight. Didn't matter as I had my iPhone loaded up with videos / music except Air China won't let you use your phone on the flight even with flight mode switched on! The food was pretty rubbish and the aisles seemed narrow. I know you get what you pay for and I'm not a fussy person for but I won't be flying Air China again. I previously flew with China Southern from Sydney to London for a cheaper price and it was a much better experience.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  2\n",
      "I flew from Chicago O'Hare to Dublin and from Dublin to Amsterdam and Amsterdam back to Dublin and Dublin back to O'Hare and I must say I was pleased with the airline. The food was good the entertainment was good and the leg room on the flights was great. Only issue I did have was from Amsterdam to Dublin because we arrived 30 minutes left and nearly missed our connecting flight from Dublin to O'Hare however we made it on time with all of our belongings. Will definitely use Aer Lingus again on any future trips to Ireland.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              2\n",
      "Reading some previous reviews and as a very nervous flyer - I was quite worried about flying with Thai Airways. I can honestly say however that I had a brilliant experience flying with them and in most aspects I wouldn't set it apart from the likes of Emirates or Ethiad. The staff were friendly and helpful - even putting up with those annoying kind of passengers who keep wondering up to the kitchen etc. The plane was clean and kept so throughout the journey. Inflight entertainment was great the same as I would expect from Ethiad/ Emirates - plenty of new releases etc. The flight was smooth and enjoyable. Would fly with them again.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               2\n",
      "The seats were small and uncomfortable. The low ticket price lures you in but after you pay the outrageous baggage fees (including carry on baggage fees) you could've just spent a little bit more to fly on a better airline. You are not even given a complimentary drink (including water).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              2\n",
      "Aug 26 UA 1683 SFO EWR. On time departure and arrival. Younger crew members more friendly than the older ones. Regular runs through the cabin with water. Captain gave regular updates. Direct TV a nice option. UA hub to hub flights seem to work more effectively than connections especially those through EWR and ORD.

      "I purchased a flight with American Airline to fly from Miami to New Orleans on July 3-7. They changed my flight to US Air but didn't inform me until one week before flight. I paid for upgrade seats but it was not transferred over. Now what really bother me was my return trip home from New Orleans well I didn't get back until a day later. Both airlines seemed to simply want to place blame on each other when they should be working together on rescheduling flights when they cancel them. American whom I booked with originally were of absolutely no use to me once they changed me to a US Air flight. Though it took many back and forth trips between the two companies finally a supervisor with US Air provided me with some assistance in getting me booked on another flight to fly out a day later. It's ridiculous that it would take me 4 hours in the airport to get rescheduled when I checked in well in advance (4hours) after my flight was canceled. I should not have needed a supervisor to get my flight rescheduled all agents should be able to do it. I went through 5 agents between AA and US Air and none were helpful. When airlines join forces to become one company they should be operating as one not passing the buck and blame between each other.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         2\n",

Superb Lufthansa service than you land in the USA and there is a long line at Passport control and no way to have an express service. I missed my connecting flight and what a surprise it was my fault and I had to pay for the hotel transport food etc.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          2\n",

      "We travelled Air Canada and Air Canada Rouge to Italy in June/July 2015. For once, we have very positive things to say about Air Canada. Air Canada Rouge was very comfortable for the longer flights overseas - even offering meals, snacks, blankets and pillows. The inflight entertainment we used on our own Apple devices worked very well, and there was one plug in our seat area for charging. It was nice to be able to choose our seats ahead of time with no charges as well. The most positive thing we have to say about our flights is that I accidentally left my ipad mini on board our very last flight going into Halifax. The flight attendant went out of her way to turn my ipad into lost and found and even emailed me telling me this. It had ended up in St John's, NFLD, where we arranged pick up to have it returned to us. We received it a couple of days later. I am very thankful and grateful to her and the other employees in lost and found who made sure I received my ipad back! As far as I'm concerned, they went above and beyond.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 2\n",
      "LAX-SFO: Simple flight made easier by a relaxed crew. Great entertainment system blankets and pillows and a nice flow of a small meal and after-meal snack plus plenty to drink. Flight crew was very attentive from the moment of boarding and remained friendly throughout. Never had a grumpy flight crew with Virgin which cannot be said for other domestic carriers. Really great if you're a fan of the SF Giants on this particular route as they show World Series highlights on the SF Giants channel.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             2\n",
      "Flew FRA-MNL-FRA. First leg delayed (3 hrs) because they had to change an tyre. The seats are a bit hard and overused on the 777 but I choose them because of the 34 inch seats and legroom. The food was ok and the cabin crew very professional. Flight to and from MNL was in a new 737/800 and everything was ok. Flight back to FRA was on time food and crew ok. It is now the 5th consecutive year that I have taken MAS. In future I will still choose MAS because of their service legroom good prices and the short stop in KUL.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   2\n",
      "Manchester to Perth business class. Experience from Manchester to Dubai was very disappointing. Boarding was chaotic and very disorganised the service from the young male attendants very poor. They had run out of my food choice and the business section was almost empty. The food I was given the seafood stew was inedible. The TV did not work a lady did move me but that was just an hour before we landed. All in all a bad experience. Considering the cost of the flight I have travelled with Emirates in economy and the service was better. Flight from Dubai to Perth was better the attendants were excellent - what a difference that made.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               2\n",
      "We arrived at the airport before 2pm - our flight was at 9.45 pm. Usually when you arrive so far in advance JetBlue try to accommodate you on an earlier flight with no charge. We had the chance to take the flight at 2.40pm JetBlue had space on that flight but they wanted to charge $50 per person (group of 4) instead they put us on stand by for 7 hours. I travel a lot because of my business and I have never had this issue with other airlines.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                2\n",
      "I used Air Greenland on a trip from Copenhagen to Kangerlussuaq on to Aasiaat Ummanaq Ilulissat then back to Kangerlussuaq and Copenhagen. The flights from Copenhagen to Kangerlussuaq and return were on modern A330s. I flew business class which was excellent for an average flight time of 4.5 hours. The transatlantic flights were smooth crew efficient and friendly seats comfortable and equipped with video monitors and the aircraft clean. Domestic flights were flown on Dash 7 rather old but clean and a reliable aircraft. All flights on time. On the downside any flight that has an intermediate stopover requires one to deplane and wait in the boarding lounge. At markedly cold temperatures walking on the tarmac to the terminal is not necessarily the most enjoyable experience. Overall though this is a very good airline and I do not hesitate recommending them.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            2\n",
      "I booked 2 seats in economy with KLM - Cape Town to Luxembourg return. I choose certain seats and paid a premium of about R5000 and my tickets reflected the seats in which I wanted to sit. On checking in at Cape Town my wife and I were placed in different seats well apart from each other. I complained and it was rectified. On return the same thing happened and I was told to check at Amsterdam to have the situation corrected. Again we were in different seats and not what we had paid for and apart from each other. The lady at the KLM counter said she was sorry but could not do anything. I had to upgrade at a cost of R25000 so that my wife and I could sit together.

      "I flew from Toronto to Tokyo on my way to Manila on 22 Oct and had the worst service experience I had in a long haul flight (12 hrs). I was seated at the window seat on several occasions I had a request for food water in the middle of the flight I pressed the attendant button waited more than 20 mins then an attendant went by and just went past no stopping on our side of the aisle and asking if anybody needed anything this happened in the middle of the flight when everyone was asleep so I didn't want to call out loudly but was waving my hands. This went on for 3 more attendant passes me before I was able to get the attention of an attendant. On the way back flying from Tokyo to Toronto I opted for an aisle seat thinking it was easier to get their attention it was but they were not the friendliest or most cordial I was asking for snacks in the middle of the long flight I was asked to go to the back myself to get pretzels and cookies. No more long haul Air Canada flights for me if I can avoid it.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            1\n",
      "I have travelled on numerous occasions with Easyjet and have never had any problems. On one occasion my flight back from Goa to London arrived early and when I asked about a change of flight from Gatwick to Edinburgh the female on reception checked and I had it done within minutes free of charge. I have never met any rude staff or unhelpful staff I have always found the staff very nice and polite. Treat them with courtesy and you will receive it back.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      1\n",
      "Flew 747 Business SIN to BNE connecting with my Air France flight from Paris. Flight Attendants were pleasant and helpful and the flat bed seats were comfortable. Food was disgusting and mean! Although the flight departed at 7.20 pm we were offered \" supper\" which consisted of a small dish of inedible food (dry rubbery pork and tasteless rice) a slice of bread and a tub of ice cream. Breakfast was similarly lacking - choice of a small bowl of muesli or a bowl of fruit or a slice of egg pie and the worst coffee ever! After the wonderful service food and wine on my recent Air France flights Qantas was a disappointment. Worst business class I have flown and one of the most expensive.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            1\n",
      "Manila to Legaspi. Ticket bought 1 month in advance via Internet for about 15EUR no problems paying by card. Unfortunately had the same experience as Mark - the flight was cancelled. The official reason was bad weather in the target destination but later on met people having travelled to the same destination the same day but with Airphil. A majority of passengers were rebooked for the next day (they basically merged the 2 flights – was the low number of passengers the reason for the cancellation?). The next day everything OK the flight without problems. If you don’t care about time fly with Zest – it is cheap.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    1\n",
      "American Airlines without notification or reason cancelled my ticket on the return leg of my trip leaving me stranded. The flight to Seattle from Philadelphia went smoothly. I was able to check in board and fly without problem and it was actually one of my most pleasant flights. However when I tried to check in for the return flight I was informed that my ticket had been cancelled. After waiting on hold for a long time one of the American Airlines representatives informed me that the ticket was cancelled because I never boarded the plane in Philadelphia. Eventually I was told that if I showed my boarding pass from the flight from Philadelphia to Seattle to a check-in representative they would be able to book a seat on the flight for me. However until that time the seat was not reserved for me or guaranteed in any way. It was important that I make the flight in order to be at work so I had to make an extra trip to the airport early so I could re-book my ticket thereby wasting precious vacation time. So do not fly on American Airlines unless you enjoy the thrill of not knowing if you'll get to use the ticket you bought the mystery of whether the airline knows you're on the plane or not and the excitement of using vacation time to pick your way through a companies complex inaccessible and unable customer service system.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   1\n",
      "Had a flight from Sofia to Budapest through Vienna. When I arrived at Vienna airport the flight to Budapest was delayed and planned for some 30 mins late. Later they announced that the airplane is expected to depart from Zagreb and will arrive at 11.35 and further information will be provided soon. Heard no more information and went to gate at 11.30 they said that the flight had finished boarding. I was then charged for the next flight to Budapest. So beware of Vienna airport notifications.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              1\n",
      "London Heathrow to Zagreb return in economy. Used the BA app to check in at both airports. Both flights on time. I found the crew were friendly and got the job done. They appeared to enjoy their work. The flight back from Zagreb was almost completely full - but the crew were good and ensured that everyone was catered for.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          1\n",
      "TelAviv-Tashkent-Tokyo Osaka-Tashkent-TLV plus TLV-Tashkent-BKK-Tashkent-TLV coach on all legs. Low cost airline means low maintenance in the planes the seats were coming apart the inflight entertainment was only in Uzbek (or Russian). We didn't try their food but the special meals we ordered were awful. Out of the 8 legs only one (the last thankfully) did we feel unsafe and that was because of turbulence. We flew high season and paid about 40% of the regular fare so cannot complain. I would not fly with them if the difference in price was not so huge.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               1\n",
      "MEL-BWN-MNL return. Best inflight catering I have experienced yet. No alcohol was not a problem I did take some and the cabin crew provided mixers. Cabin crew were attentive friendly and helpful. Planes had adequate legroom and were clean. Brunei's airport is small and not much to do it is about to be renovated.

      "London Luton to Warsaw Chopin and Return. December 2013. Arrived 15 minutes late outbound back on time. Staff were helpful and friendly. This is a classic Low cost carrier operation and you get what you pay for - the only problem with this kind of tarmac dash boarding is if you want to make sure you sit next to each other then you need to buy priority boarding. I had read other reports prior to the flight and wasn't looking forward to it but the experience was much better than I thought it would be. I think the problems on these airlines are caused by people who don't abide by the rules and expect a full service airline product on a low cost carrier. They do have two baggage sizes for cabin baggage and they do enforce it - measure your bag before you go to the airport and accept if its not \"small\" you will end up paying for it. I would recommend and I would use again.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             1\n",
      "We have flown with a number of other airlines both internationally and domestic and flying United was a nightmare. Weather is out of everyone's control but management of the overall system is a disaster and not equipped on the front line to deal with flight problems. We normally fly in and out of MSP but United ORD on the surface offered better options for connections to and from Toronto. The problems in Chicago from what information we managed to get (mostly from other passengers both on our flight and other flights) were they did not know where aircraft crews were where the planes were coming and going or what gate (we were moved 3 times-one of which was on the opposite end of the terminal). We have had less delays and problems flying out of MSP in brutal winter weather. They make no announcements and changes are not posted timely and if you can't get an audience with very limited counter agents you find out your flight has been cancelled when the boarding time has come and gone. We witnessed that time and again. We were rebooked on the same flight 24 hours later-and as expected no luggage when we arrived-the tracking showed the time and place it was checked in more than 24 hours earlier at ORD-no progress up the chain in over 24 hours. I honestly feel for the counter people who have to deal with the chaos and irate passengers with little information and resources to fix problems-no wonder they may be less than friendly at times. I do believe there are huge and unnecessary internal problems with this airline (or airport) because we have flown from coast to coast foreign countries and very bad weather with other airlines (and airports) that managed to deal with flight problems in a more efficient and passenger friendly manner. Who cares about the free soda with no ice - it would appear United-ORD has much much bigger problems.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          1\n",
      "Because of bad weather in SFO our flight from PHL was delayed and caused us to miss our SIA flight 001 to HKG. We were re-routed to LAX for ANA 1005 to Tokyo-Haneda. What a pleasant surprise. Business class on 777. From the LAX service desk personal to the cabin staff it was a perfect travel experience. The food was 5 star quality and presentation. The angled lie flat were comfy using the down comforters and large pillows.

      "Sao Paulo GRU to London LHR Economy B777-300. There were a few films I would like to have watched but the audio in my seat 45G wasn't working. The crew said it was a fault with the aircraft and nothing could be done. Two hours into the flight the water systems in the toilets failed so the crew provided bottled water - but one toilet was completely out of action which caused huge queues down the aisles. The crew on this flight were cheerful but I will not fly TAM international by choice again.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            1\n",

We had flown Sunwing for years however the decline in service is so drastic that this will be our last trip with Sunwing.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             1\n",
      "SCL-AKL. An A340 with the new LAN flat-bed seats. Selected a middle aisle seat so that no-one would have to climb over me at night. Pushing back was delayed but arrival was on-time. Dinner wine and cabin service were excellent but breakfast nothing special. LAN now offer a very similar product to Qantas. Lounge at SCL was fine. Had to wait 30 mins for a shower but it was very good when I got to use it.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        1\n",
      "Antalya - Gatwick return. I had to fly the outward leg Thomas Cook as I was taking a cat back to the UK and they are the only direct carrier that takes animals but I made the mistake of booking a return with them when I should have chosen another carrier such as Easyjet or Monarch of whom I've heard good reports on this route. Outward flight was OK nice cabin crew as always I'd paid extra for a bulkhead seat which gave me a bit of extra legroom but spent quite a lot of time standing in the over-packed aircraft. Return was a nightmare. 8 hours at Gatwick waiting for them to provide a replacement for an aircraft damaged on the tarmac. How can a so-called 3-star airline not have contingency aircraft for this - especially when it seems to happen to them so regularly? Absolutely appalling. Why do passengers put up with this? I'd paid for a legroom seat so was reasonably comfortable but apart from a £10 food voucher there was no compensation for the eight hour wait. I also paid for the 'Priority Bag' service on both legs - a total swindle my bag only turned up after at least half of the other passengers had already claimed theirs. Luckily I have other choices. Before this I was wondering if it was still worth flying via Istanbul just to get on a BA flight but this experience has proved that it definitely is. I will never fly Thomas Cook again - I'd rather fly via Reykjavik than entrust my comfort to them again and even then I'd probably get there sooner!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             1\n",
      "Flew LHR to Malta and return. Out on a A319 with plenty of legroom which was great. Back on a A320 which was terrible. Legroom was non-existent. It was as if they tried to cram in as many people as possible. Very uncomfortable for the almost 3 hour journey. I could not even read the paper there was so little room. However both flights were on time and the crew pleasant. Food going out was fine but didn't eat on the way back.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 1\n",
      "Have flown several times between Lagos domestic (Old terminal) and Warri. Flights on time and flight attendants attentive and friendly. Be warned that you'll have to hunt down your gate at Lagos if you want to be sure of catching your flight. It's not unusual for staff to just wander off for no announcements to be made and for passengers to be running across the runway at the last minute with their baggage in hand. On one occasion a Dutch wetlease service was used from Warri to Lagos older but it was a comfortable plane with one Dutch and one Nigerian FA both friendly and professional. The safety briefing was even done a second time as one passenger point blank refused to pay attention the first time and wouldn't remove their earphones. Food onboard constituted a carton of five alive juice and either a pain au chocolate or the standard Nigerian mystery meat pasty. Good luck with that one. Security at Warri as corrupt as anywhere else in Nigeria. Despite the airport being funded by Shell don't expect any special attention if you work for them though here they are particularly aggressive rather than the usual passive begging.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        1\n",

Other than that everything met the standard and surprisingly the food was not disappointing at all.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      1\n",
      "Very disappointed with the service from Thomas Cook Airlines. They left a plane load of Belfast bound passengers delayed in Tenerife Airport for 7.5 hours on Friday 17 May. When we eventually boarded the Captain apologised for the delay and then said that we should appreciate that the staff came in on rest days to get us home. I thought we paid Thomas Cook to bring us home and it was due to a good will gesture from the staff!!

      "September 6 2013 Business Class from Frankfurt to Santiago via Sao Paulo. Airplane 777 fairly new. FA's make you feel they were doing you a favor bringing you food. Very cold service attitude and sometimes rude. They expected everyone to speak Portuguese. Plane in this section had 3 bathroom one was kept locked only for FA's to use. They did not care there was a line and still kept the bathroom closed. Food was ok nothing special. Inflight entertainment had a poor selection of films. Chaotic boarding in SAO.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            1\n",
      "My wife and I were in a group of 47 travelers flying Alitalia from New York to Rome and return. We have been on hundreds and hundreds of flights but our experience Alitalia recently is perhaps the worst ever. The primary reason was the seating situation. We were flying economy plus but most of the group was in economy. Not only were seats jammed together but they did not recline. It appeared they were moulded plastic seats with cushions that slid down a bit to offset the lack of replying. It was agony. The entire group without exception were totally negative on the seating situation. several of our group found themselves in seats that had metal boxes on the floor so they could not extend their legs fully. 'Breakfast\" on our return flight consisted of two pieces of cake. Coffee was consistently lukewarm. Stay away from Altalia at least on their JFK to Rome service.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 1\n",
      "Heathrow to Sofia. A very crowded flight but good staff if not overly friendly. More or less on time. Good drink service and food okay. I think Air Bulgaria need more flights at Heathrow though as this was rammed. Newspapers circulated but no English ones on a flight out of London? Another dislike is the setbacks had very narrow rigid space for storing stuff meaning you were limited to one or two magazines but no space for water books etc.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  1\n",
      "Oslo - Moscow - St Petersburg return. Fine crew meals and planes. Boarding in A319 in Oslo took some 40 minutes most of which were spent inside the aircraft waiting for other passengers to take their seats - thanks to lack of management and guidance from the cabin crew. Due to this arrived to Sheremetyevo D with a 35 minutes delay cutting my connection time down to 40 minutes. Passport control /customs very fast. Waited for luggage about 15 minutes. Ran to the transfer desk where two of the three staff said they can offer re-booking for a later flight to LED. However the third representative was extremely helpful did few phone calls to warn the gate that I am coming and basically ran with me through the corridors carrying my luggage to the LED flight gate. Unfortunately the flight to LED was delayed people were standing at the gate for 40 minutes hearing no info but only \"5 more minutes!\". Finally the gate personal announced cancellation of the flight and we were rescheduled for the flight departing in 2 hours. On the way back from St Petersburg everything went smoothly I even did not need to pick up my luggage at Sheremetyevo for customs clearance. Service and flights were just great. Aeroflot does change for the better but has to put more effort into ground staff training and customer service. English training for the crew is necessary as well. As for lack of smiles - I guess this is simply a cultural feature - Russians generally reserve smiles for situations of fun and/or pleasure and apparently Aeroflot staff do not feel much of either at work.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       1\n",
      "We flew Sunwing on Jan 7th 338 from Saskatoon to Santa Clara Cuba. We found that Sunwing is the worst to fly with they will leave you stranded in an airport it took us a day longer to get there than it should have. I would not fly with them again.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      1\n",
      "Mumbai - Colombo - Heathrow return. The cabin was clean and well maintained. Comfort good in the economy seats. There was confusion regarding seat allocation (when a lady decided she would be assigned my seat for her baby - which was not the case) but the situation was handled quite well by the head of cabin crew. I am 6'5\" tall and legroom is almost always an issue but crew and airport staff ensured my seats were booked on emergency exit or the front row. The meals were almost excellent. The in-flight entertainment could do with more channels and aircraft was quite dated on he Mumbai - Colombo sector.

      "I've flown 10 years in a row every Feb IAD or DCA to SJO - 5 times on TACA. I've found the staff to be friendly & helpful. I speak about 10 words of Spanish and never found that to be a problem. The food as of Feb 2009 was still free as were drinks I wanted. The extra $$$ for a checked bag was only for over 50 lbs - so far no trouble with lost bags. Carry along your own headphones or there is a $5 fee. Also the connect in Salvador is much better than Atlanta or Miami. My only complaint is the seats are a bit snug.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      1\n",
      "Flew 4th May from Birmingham to Izmir transfer at Istanbul. Flight out was delayed no reason given arrived in a mad panic at istanbul transfer gate with 15 minutes to spare but transfer flight to Izmir was also delayed by 1 hour no reason given. Return flight from Izmir was also delayed no reason given leaving us again in a mad dash to the transfer gate. Arrived just as they were boarding but our luggage did not transfer. Had to fill in a form at Birmingham and it was delivered to our home a day later.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  1\n",
      "Mumbai-Riyadh-Bahrain. Mumbai to Riyadh was Boeing 777-200. 90% of passengers were Indian blue-collared workers. The FA's were welcoming to everyone alike. Everyone was greeted with a smiling face. Mango/orange juice was served and the lunch service began. Food was hot (had to wait for 5 minutes for it to cool down). Inflight entertainment was fairly good. Unfortunately our row's computers weren't responding. Stopover at Riyadh was 4 hours. The airport had charging points and many cafe's with affordable drinks and eatables - gets boring if you dont have personal entertainment. Riyadh to Bahrain was an Embraer 35 seater. The scheduled duration was 1 hour 10 minutes but the actual time taken was just 50 minutes. 10 minutes after takeoff lunch was served (goes without mentioning it was piping hot) the meal was filling with salad dessert and a main course. The trays were taken back within 20 minutes. In short the entire 10 hours journey was pleasing and worth the cost. I should mention that I got the ticket for 1/5th the original price because of a special offer. Worth every penny and I wouldn't mind paying the whole fare as well.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     1\n",
      "MNL-SIN return economy. Check in at MNL terminal 2 was slow but moving considering the number of flights departing and the limited ground crew available. Traveling with 3 kids we were allowed to board early Crew on both legs (same ones) very friendly and chatting with passengers and helping with carry on baggage to facilitate boarding. An hour before landing my youngest had severe motion sickness and the flight attendants were quick to help me clean up the mess and freshen the air. Food however was terrible both legs.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  1\n",
      "Will never fly Frontier Airlines again. We were scheduled to fly to Tucson via Milwaukee to Denver to Tucson. When checking in in Milwaukee we were told our outbound Milwaukee to Denver flight was delayed by two hours. As a result we would miss our Denver to Tucson flight. For the next 75 minutes we waited to be rebooked on a flight arriving in Tucson 24 hours later. Terrible service. No apologies nothing. You get what you pay for with this airline.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        1\n",
      "Flight ARN-MAN. Via the SAS website we applied and got an SAS Plus upgrade for £30/each. We had the double baggage allowance were fast-tracked through security and spent time in the SAS business lounge which was quiet had free wifi reasonable snack and drink selection (the Absolut promotional Martinis were great). SAS used the first three rows for their Plus passengers (18 places using middle seat too - 16 were used) and there was use of extra storage at the front and to hang your coat. Plus passengers get to choose what they want from the on-board shop (a reasonable range) free of charge. We had a tasty pork meal (cold meal) and wine served with a proper Orrefors glasses. Staff were very friendly attentive and obliging to requests. The flight was on time (very nearly full) and went smoothly. At Manchester our priority tagged bags were first on the belt again an excellent Manchester service - landing to driving off home 30mins. A great product a relaxed style Plus/business class though with all the usual perks well worth the money.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      1\n",
      "LHR-CDG-LYS. Got assigned seat 3A in Premium Eco on LHR-CDG leg which is always nice and seems to happen to me quite often on this route. It doesn't make much of a difference on such a short flight - even though you do get better food - but sitting at the front of the aircraft makes the boarding/ disembarking process a breeze. Transfer between to 2E and 2F at CDG can be a bit of a hassle but both terminals are new and relatively easy to navigate. Nothing exceptional on CDG-LYS leg but an overall pleasant experience.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    1\n",
      "Flew from Vancouver to Maui and back. We booked on points and quite frankly I had no idea what Rouge was before we even boarded the plane. Biggest complaint was about lack of in-flight entertainment. As a parent with two younger kids in-flight movies are a lifesaver. I was floored to see that missing. Did we have other options - yes. We had our own ipad books etc. What was galling was to be told \"you can access movies from your ipad but only if you have the app downloaded first\". Of course that is useless advice once in the air so guess what? We have iPads for rent for $10. It's the nickel-and-diming on every last thing possible that drives me nuts. The plane was huge and full and yes seats are cramped. I am 5'8 and did okay my husband though at 6'4 it was an agonizing trip particularly the red-eye on the way back. Finally the crew. They all looked very young and the inexperience showed. A young Dad wasn't seated with his wife infant and toddler and was told to \"ask around to see if someone will switch\". He said \"I was told you would help me with that\" to which the response was \"there will be lots of people who'll want to switch if you ask around.\" Not sure if she ever did lend assistance. There are other nitpicky things (flight was more than an hour late leaving Maui) etc. Nothing was disastrous but all the little annoyances add up. I am officially done. To be charged for every little thing plus have poor service and the prices aren't even that much better? No thanks I'm out!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                1\n",
      "Denver to Midland scheduled departure time was supposed to be 2.15pm. The flight was delayed 3 times and all while the plane was sitting at the boarding gate. The airline employee spike very broken English. Said that anyone traveling with children needed to be checked due to weight restrictions. She then said that 6 people needed to give up their seats for luggage of other travelers or she would not let the last people that checked in on the flight. No one volunteered so she picked 6 people 2 of which were military personnel. Once on the plane people were told to move seats to even out weight since. We will never fly with this airline again.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    1\n",
      "On a recent vacation from Sacramento to Paris some friends and I had a terrible experience with another airline and had some trepidation about our return flight from Paris to Sacramento. We did however choose British Airways for the return flight and none of us had flown with them before. I am happy to report that the experience was totally different. Our flight was delayed by an hour which did effect our layover and did rush us to our next flight but we had a cushion of 2 hours layover so we were ok. On the flight the seats were more comfortable more leg room less noisy better entertainment due to screens on seats in front of you and the access to the bathroom was much easier to navigate. We also had seats relatively together which the other airline refused to offer us even though we had made the reservation months in advance. Their screen was so far ahead I couldn't see it and it offered only one choice. The staff was very kind to hydrate us frequently and gave us plenty to eat and it was all very palatable. I will definitely recommend British Airways for International flights to my friends.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       1\n",
      "My 13 year old recently flew as an unaccompanied minor with Emirates on a return trip from Perth Australia to Glasgow (via Dubai). He arrived back in Perth with us yesterday and I have to say I have been very impressed with this service from start to finish. We were naturally dubious about him flying alone at first but Emirates were organised efficient and professional. They even upgraded him to first class for one leg of the trip.

      "Shenzhen to Beijing. When it looked like a delay was possible they arranged for us to move to another gate where a back-up plane was ready. I was greeted by name by flight attendants. One even stopped to give me a small Chinese lesson so I could order my food in Chinese! I found the food simple but delicious. At check-in a young lady directed me from the general area to a special lane for Sky Priority members which I had forgotten. The check-in was very fast and there is a special line for security as well which was nice.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              1\n",
      "CMN-LHR. Check-in was slow and disorganised dealing with a passenger's overweight baggage in front of us at the counter took them nearly half an hour during which the check-in attendants changed shift! Boarding was a shambles - 15 mins after heading into the airbridge people started coming out again for what reason I am not sure but it resulted in both staff members leaving their posts at the gate so random people could just walk onto the plane. Those of us at the back of the queue got on without anyone looking at our boarding passes! Meal was tasteless mush (I chose the fish) and the announcements were deafeningly loud and distorted. For this reason they decided not to play the movie which we can be thankful for. Plane was a bit old but not too bad comfort level was OK but seats weren't the greatest.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 1\n",
      "MAD-LIM-MAD-LHR with Iberia was a far better experience than I had expected. All flights on time with clean well presented aircraft smiling crews plenty of food (on the long haul sectors). All in all a good experience. The only down side is the lack of seat back IFE on the A340-600s at this point.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   1\n",
      "When I first started flying from PHX to BIL on Allegiant about four years ago I was thrilled large plane direct flight great prices. Even though I had to drive 2 hours to get to Phoenix from Tucson it was worth it. I told everyone about this great little airline. Well that great little airline seems to be suffering from growing pains. In other words they've gotten too big for their britches. They're charging prices like the big carriers (in spite of the fact that fuel prices are half of what they were a year ago) but not offering the same service. They nickel-and-dime you to death: $5 to print your boarding pass for you? $50 for an overweight bag (down to 40 lbs. allowable - it used to be 50 lbs.). Having to purchase water? Paying for seat assignment and checked and carry-on bags? What's next pay toilets on the plane? The worst part is trying to call their \"customer service\" number. I needed to change my reservation but wasn't allowed to do so using their website. While I waited on hold for 35 minutes to find out what the additional fare would be I had to listen to a recording continually telling me that I should be using their website instead. On the up side both my flights were actually on time for a change. Allegiant seems to want to charge large carrier prices without providing large carrier service (which isn't exactly anything to rave about either). If they want to sit at the grown-ups table they better learn to put their napkin in their lap instead of tucking it under their chin. Speaking of napkins I wonder when they'll start charging for those too?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              1\n",
      "We upgraded to J class from Y class for a flight from Shanghai to Bangkok a stopover point between Shanghai and Colombo. At the time of the upgrade the call centre informed me that the plane was a new updated A340. After the upgrade was complete and the seat plan made available for J class it became evident that it was in fact an old A340 with bucket seats rather than lie flats. Check-in took 45 minutes in the J Class counter with 2 people in front of us. and an empty business class. The Lounge at Shanghai Terminal 2 was mediocre and the lounge staff incompetent not knowing where the flight was boarding or when we should be boarding. They actually made us almost miss our flight by taking us for an unnecessary drive along the tarmac. We eventually got back to the terminal building and found our way to the plane after running away from lounge staff. The flight itself was ok. The plane was old with uncomfortable seats. Once the person in front put his seat back you were completely restricted and could not extend your seat fully. The seats were not great. The staff were very good and friendly and so was the food. All in all they did make up for the sub-standard equipment. The IFE was almost non existent. The airline has a long way to go.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        1\n",
      "GA 89 with commencement of direct flight between CGK-AMS I finally managed to try the brand new B777-300ER in Y class. The hospitality of the cabin crew is excellent and the service has been great. The meals were very nice what I noticed was that they have introduced a new meal tray which is more appealing however the quantity is still a bit small for the 14-hour flight. The entertainment system has been updated and changed to newer system the touch screen is more responsive and selection of movies and songs are relatively new. Seat-wise the seat is comfortable and homely looking but I still do not find it wide enough for some people. Overall I was very impressed with the service and can't wait for their service between CGK-AMS-LGW.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       1\n",
      "My husband and I have been trying to get home since 4/6/2014 we were booked on a flight at 4.10 after a one hour delay they cancelled it. We couldn't get booked on another flight so we had to stay over. They booked us on flight #2575 at 9.25 then overnight somehow we got cancelled even though we had recheck boarding passes. We were re- booked for a noon flight #2419. Then after being directed to 2 different gates and waiting in the airport for over 12 hours today 4/7/2014 our flights to Albuquerque were canceled. We were sent to 5 different gates during the 12 hours. 3 cancellations in 24 hours it's unacceptable customer service.

      "Dubai - Kathmandu return. Both flights delayed by an hour and very busy. Outbound agents at the gate wisely checked in lots of hand luggage into the hold (for free) due to minimal storage space onboard. Outbound flight had no IFE and was disappointed with no inflight magazine (but then they have taken out the seat pockets so there would be nowhere to put it anyway!). Return flight was on a brand new brilliant B737 with personal IFE and mood lighting. Excellent crew who handled a medical emergency well and all were very engaging with passengers - really good to see. Transfer to T3 to connect with Emirates was smooth although distances are long so it takes time. Had to collect boarding pass in DXB which wasn't the case when checking in out the inbound - be good to resolve this - although reassuring that he baggage tickets were scanned and confirmed and all arrived at final destination.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             1\n",
      "Two of us flew premium economy over a two month period from LHR-Hong Kong HK-Sydney Perth-Hong Kong and Hong Kong-London. Cathay are to be commended on allowing customers seat selection long before you fly at no cost (unlike BA). Staff make this airline - plenty of them attentive smiling and enjoying their job. Throughout the flights the staff are very responsive to any request from your seat for food or assistance. Dinners/lunches are excellent with perfect fish & steaks a great selection of wines/beers and an open galley with a full selection of snacks fruit and drinks. Breakfasts offer a good selection of fruit yoghurt roll and western/eastern options but the sausages are awful! Our last leg was delayed badly by horrendous weather in Hong Kong and although the crew made up for it once airborne it would really help passengers if clear concise information was given to the passengers waiting at the gate. This is a problem with all airlines - no information when things go wrong. IFE was very good premium economy seats are very comfortable and sleeping is easy. Toilet in premium economy is very helpful as is priority boarding ahead of economy. Finally the bag drop off in Hong Kong/Kowloon way ahead of your flight is incredibly convenient. Never lost a bag yet! Good luck Cathay Pacific.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     1\n",
      "Langkawi-KUL economy class. Seamless online check in same at airport bag drop. On time departure (in fact a couple of minutes early) and spot on time arrival in KUL. Fully loaded aircraft with lots of large family groups typical for the time end of April. Meal was very good. Staff on board very professional without being overly friendly. Seats are a normal. The aisles were like a busy thoroughfare all flight. All in all a perfect flight when taking prices etc into consideration.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          1\n",
      "CI916 and CI8 July 31. I traveled from Hong Kong to LA. The check-in service is not as good as I expected. She confirmed me in an exit seat but I found I was in the last-narrow row seat. The only thing I was not satisfied with was the seat space. China Airlines does not give as much as leg and feet space as other economy's for the last row passengers. The food - ok. The cabin - ok. Maybe I will choose China Airlines again but I will not recommend to my friends and families.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               1\n",
      "Brussels - Cairo - Dar Es Salaam in economy. Small and older aircraft on first leg completely full. Older seats standard interior nothing special. Newspapers in French English and Arabic. Food was ok. Leg space ok. For the price nothing to complain. Second leg also small to medium aircraft with same interior and same service. No problems at all no fancy things either.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           1\n",
      "Trip from Atlanta to Denver. No issues in Atlanta crew was very nice. In Denver the desk staff were borderline rude and wouldn't acknowledge you unless you use the kiosk to print the boarding pass but no one was willing to explain how to use the kiosk. Then had to reprint the boarding pass at the kiosk for unexplained reasons. I want to deal with people not computers. Desk staff was rude in Denver but flight crew was refreshing. Flight from Atlanta was actually early and return flight was on time.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       1\n",
      "Traveled 4 segments. HKG-SIN-SYD and return on a 772ER 773ER A388 and A333. Haven't flown long haul with them for quite a few years but I think it has deteriorated. Seat pitch is too tight for an airline like SQ and the cost cutting in services is apparent with the bottle of water provided gone and wine glasses replaced by plastic and red and white wines now poured from a large bottle instead of the airline sizes they used to provide. I also remembered when flying long haul some years back they actually provided hot chocolate drinks throughout the night which doesn't exist anymore. It just feels a lot more budget than it used to be. In terms of the cabin and plane 773ER had the best IFE and new seats which i think is slightly more comfortable than the ones on the A388 and A333 which had identical seats and IFE but still I regard those seats as being too hard. While the A333 is supposed to be the newest plane at just 2 years old the fact that it's leased and a bridging plane meant that it was fitted with old seats and IFE the same as the A388 which SIA has flown as much as a decade. Service is OK overall but the SYD-SIN leg had a rather less enthusiastic air steward serving my section but I do accept that there are the occasional bad days. Sharp contrast to EK which I have also used during this trip. Seats better legroom better IFE better food better beverages better.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                1\n",
      "Berlin-Dusseldorf and Dusseldorf-Miami and Miami-Denver with American Airlines Jan 6 2012. We had a 5-month-old infant with us in Berlin the crew spoke little English so when we asked for 'deliver at the gate' tags for the baby's stroller they checked in the stroller as regular baggage all the way to Denver. In Miami we had a 6-hour layover and nothing to put the baby in. From Dusseldorf to Miami we didn't get a bassinet for the child as they supposedly were all booked. However when we walked around the plane it turned out that only one was in use. We ended up sitting in the last row by the restrooms where seats could not be reclined. We struggled to accommodate the baby for 10 hrs 40 mins. The crew was unpleasant when I asked for hot water to warm the baby's milk. I would not recommend Air Berlin.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    1\n",
      "Have made numerous Cebu Pacific flights throughout Asia within the Philippines flights are generally good value for money but strict on baggage allowance. Found at BKK staff standing on edges of baggage scales adding between 2-5kg to actual weight of baggage so allowing them to claim excess baggage fees. My last flight from UK was weighed for internal UK flight at 23kg this was the same for my international flight from UK to Manila but for my internal flight from Manila to Cebu my baggage had suddenly gained 5.5kg in weight to 28.5kg - so excess baggage fees charged!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                1\n",

Same on the way back from Goa to Mumbai but crew not good at all on Mumbai to London flight as previously stated they were more interested in chatting with each other rather than serving customer.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               1\n",
      "SYD-NRT-SFO return Dec 2011/Jan 2012. Premium Economy seat was not as good as I thought. The leg room was fine as I am not tall person but the seat recline was just as bad as economy. The lounge service was a bonus. The food was the same as economy and was ok. Movie selections pretty much the same as other airlines. FA's were professional polite and pleasant.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    1\n",
      "An absolute surprise! I flew from Belgrade to London on a Sunday morning and was expecting something pretty awful Instead I would rate it as the best European flight I have taken in the past year! Maybe it has something to do with Air Serbia's link up with Etihad but in any case the staff were pleasant I was offered a choice of hot main meal in economy there was plenty of leg room and the flight left and arrived on time. Couldn't ask for more!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              1\n",
      "Just got back from Tenerife. What a horrible flight no coffee no hot chocolate only half the selection of hot food - no sandwiches. To top it off Ryanair ran out of toilet roll. But they had plenty of fags and booze and not forgetting the scratch cards. Never again. To be honest it shouldn't be called a budget airline either not at the price I paid.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              1\n",
      "Our first flight to Kenya on the Dreamliner 787 Dec 10th 2013. All cabin staff welcoming and helpful. Flight started off on time but due to people arriving late and luggage going missing we sat on the Tarmac for nearly an hour before we took off. Flight went smoothly and was non eventful. We were in premium class and seats were comfortable and leg room more than adequate. Only gripe was that the centre arm rest which stored the screens stuck out making it difficult to manoeuvre when people in front had their seats reclined. Usually feel rubbish for first few days on arrival in Kenya but can honestly say I didn't have that jet lagged feeling this time. The flight back on 24th Dec was as equally comfortable. Again all cabin staff friendly and hard working. Slight problem with water leaking but that soon stopped once we were airborne. Again flight went smoothly with no problems. Plenty of duty fees available on flight back. The food was edible on both flights and drinks were constantly flowing. We had to disembark at south terminal due to flooding in north terminal. That was a nightmare and took 1.5 hrs to get suitcases. No announcements made so it was a case of wait and see. We enjoyed our Dreamliner experience.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                1\n",
      "Flew TLV-LHR 317 on Sep 3 2012. Flight was fairly full but boarding was uneventful. Food was OK although entertainment was very limited. The overhead lights on both our seats didn't work. I asked to be re-seated and there was a vacant seat across the aisle from us however the stewardess said I couldn't sit there. Instead she offered me an alternative seat further to the front of the aircraft just behind a squalling baby.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     1\n",
      "Atlanta to Paris twice in December 2013. On both the Atlanta-Paris flights the first immediate sensation upon boarding the plane was the strong stench of urine. Imagine suffering that for the first 2-3 hours of the flight. On the Air France flight from Paris to Bangalore at takeoff the door to one of the four toilets was already taped up and marked \"unusable\". 3 hours into the flight the one across from it got clogged up leaving only two operating toilets for the entire Economy section. The food was terrible not even properly heated up. There were no snacks brought out by staff. The seats have no cushioning left completely worn out. The quality of service has decreased a lot over the past 2 years.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           1\n",
      "YVR–MNL-YVR (Aug 26 Sep 10). The service was great. The flight attendants were always available to assist passengers and several times they go around to give water and snacks. They serve dinner and breakfast. The food is tasty and comparable with other Asian airlines. The B777-300 aircraft is spotless the legroom is ample the seat will recline and it has personal entertainment system with good selections of movies games and music. Overall PAL did a good job and I will fly with them again.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                1\n",
      "ORD-MAD MAD-PAM (Pamplona) was a tight connection but was at the gate 25 minutes before boarding only to learn the plane had taken off 30 minutes early than the scheduled departure time. Ran into some trouble rebooking on the next flight however did make it to Pamplona 3 hours behind schedule. On our return flight in Barcelona we were at the gate 2 hours before departure back to the states. The information on the screen at the gate was incorrect and when questioned the Iberia representative explained that our flight was next and that the current flight was a different flight. Ourselves and 3 other couples missed the flight as that was our plane. We tried to rebook and the Iberia personnel accused us of not being at the gate on time. When we escalated the issue to management she was worse. Told us she would be happy to help if we paid her an additional 3000 euros for a new ticket to the states. We had to purchase new tickets home from Delta.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   1\n",
      "I hadn't flown in years and was excited to fly again. Found the best rates with Spirit and was ready to go. Everything went downhill from there. Once you arrive you get hit with all theses extra fees for everything from baggage to snacks and soda on the plane. Then the seats are so cramped this is the first plane I've been on where my knees touch the seat in front of me. In the end it would have been cheaper and more comfortable to fly with another airline. Never again will I fly with Spirit.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            1\n",
      "YYZ-YYC. TV worked properly for a change managed to get most of the channels. Crew seemed disinterested in doing their work which is a little unusual for Westjet. I do have to say though I can't stand their seats. I am only 5'9\" but the seat ends about half way down my thigh. There is no support and after 4+ hours a little tiring. Don't think I would fly them long distances.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    1\n",
      "Flew business from London Gatwick to Barbados for our semi-annual trip to the luxury Crane Resort. This was our second time flying Virgin and experienced no major issues. There were some minor delays before takeoff but that is to be expected. The food on the flight was no better and no worse than previous airline food that we've experienced although after being spoiled for a week at the Crane resort the food seemed a little bland. Inflight entertainment was great with a decent selection of up to date movies although we usually just sleep the whole way.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               1\n",
      "LGW-LAS return last week the quality of the staff and the food in the economy cabin left a lot to be desired the staff looked tired and on occasions seemed sullen the food was some of the worse I have had on an international flight I felt as if the staff gave the impression that the passengers were a bit of a bind only to be tolerated certainly not service with a smile. real or otherwise. I would suggest that the owner of this airline travels in economy to experience the conditions for himself.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          1\n",
      "SIN-CEB return flight on SilkAir flight was punctual. Seating was good but food service was somewhat disappointing. Entertainment is provided on shared drop down screens but no sound! You watch programming in silence. Silkair is claiming to be best regional airline but service provided is only on par with other budget carriers such as Cebu Pacific. Cost of flights are vastly greater than the other low cost carriers who offer comparable service and only becomes a viable choice when used as an add on flight to Singapore Airways flights.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 1\n",
      "CPH-YEG. Second spin long haul with Icelandair and I'm still happy with my choice. First leg was turbulent in the beginning but we were pre-warned by the pilot. Stewardess's were extremely friendly/helpful. Both legs were full/ had plenty of babies and demanding patrons (constantly pressing call buttons even during meal service) but they took it in stride and always came straight away with a smile. Yes if you want a meal you have to pay extra but they've always made that quite clear when you buy your tickets which re price I find extremely competitive for long distance international so I've never had an issue with that. They also take cash on-board (this flight Euro or Krone) which I've never experienced on a international or domestic flight before. Economy has a bit more leg room but this is achieved by shortening the seat length which can be a challenge in that it could make your lower half go numb. to be fair it's economy you'll never be comfortable in this section unless your a child. IES is a bit light on selection compared to other long distance haulers but most people bring a tablet or laptop anyway.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         1\n",

      "Travelled from Manchester to Melbourne in December. First time travelling with Qatar Airways was not disappointed. Our seats were very comfortable and the service was first class.

      "Flew Manchester to Las Vegas in August this year. Could not fault the flight out. Very rapid check in. Plane clean service impeccable IFE very good lots of choice and all working. Flight home was not as good but that's because the cabin crew around our section were only interested in entertaining off duty cabin crew sat in front of us. Was a night flight and had to tell them on more than one occasion to keep the noise down as passengers were trying to sleep. Also the cabin guy on this flight sat himself in the aisle to chat to his friend which was very unprofessional and annoying. Apart from that was an emptyish flight so plenty of room to spread out and took under 9 hours to get back to Manchester after being stuck on the runway in Vegas because of a storm which was a bonus. Would definitely fly with Virgin again.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   1\n",
      "Flew Air Canada Rouge to/from Costa Rica. Had never heard of Rouge and was not told that this would be the carrier even when I called to book seats and meals. There are no meals unless you buy the overpriced cold items available - very limited choice as would be expected on a flight. Had we known we would have brought our own food as we did on the return flight. Entertainment available by Air Canada app that must be downloaded before flight. A few tablets are available for rent - and they go fast. Seats are not comfortable - spent a week with back pain after 5 hours in one. There is also barely enough room to get into your seat. I'm not a large person but it was a challenged getting in and out of seat. Have flown Air Canada before and was happy with it. Not happy with Rouge and as you don't know if they will be the carrier when you book through Air Canada this will prevent me from ever booking a vacation or flight with them again. Cabin staff were friendly but not really helpful - there didn't seem to be anything they could do to help.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  1\n",
      "Three times taking China Southern Airline between Auckland NZ and Guangzhou in last 8 months. I want to highlight CZ335 on 20th January 2015 from Guangzhou to Auckland. Excellent service provided by cabin crews impressed me a lot. I was sitting in the last row (53C) which is next to the kitchen. I could see the crews and purser carefully preparing food and beverages. They only stopped when terrible turbulence occurred and resumed the service when possible. I cannot complain about the hardware and food against the price I paid but I appreciate the excellent service and warm attitude I received which exceeded my expectations.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      1\n",
      "IAD-BKK (via AUH) round-trip. IAD-AUH (A340-600) - flight only 20% full and I had the bulkhead seat with an open seat next to me. Had a great experience with in-flight food entertainment and service. I chalk that up to the empty flight and minimal stress on FA's. Bulkhead seats are normally 75$ per leg but was able to get it during online check-in. Bulkhead had plenty of legroom and you don't have to worry about reclining seats. IFE is slightly smaller and with lower graphics quality. Cons: seats are quite hard halfway through the 12 hr flight my tailbone was so sore I had to sit on a pillow for the rest of trip. Transit AUH - first time at airport and transit in evening was a breeze with minimal lines for transfer/secondary security. I had a short layover so didn't check on the facilities. Food options are limited and expensive. AUH-BKK (777) - completely full flight and boarding process was very chaotic. Basically a complete free for all boarding. They boarded by rows but gate agents were not enforcing it. I will avoid flying on 777 especially with the 3-4-3 set up and the poor seat pitch. Cabin was very hot even though I was just in a T-shirt. FA's did their best scrambling around with the full flight. Seats again were very hard and not comfortable. BKK-AUH (777) - same experience as the inbound flight. Cabin too warm and breakfast food was pretty bad on this flight. By far the worse on the trip. Boarding in BKK still very chaotic. AUH transit with US Customs pre-clearance - 3 hour layover in the early morning and airport was very busy. Secondary security had long lines and had to wait 30 min. Food options is still terrible. US pre clearance at AUH was a mixed bag. No dedicated lines for US citizens. AUH-BKK (A340) - another full flight and a complete reversal in my Etihad experience. FA had difficult time communicating with mostly South Asian customers. Meal service was a zoo - I have never seen so many different special meal requests. There's a 30-40 min lag between special meal service and regular meal service. Special meal customers ended up holding on their meals for 1 hr. Some flyers had to take their own tray back to the FA. Cabin temperature fluctuated a couple times from cold to warm. IAD luggage took forever. Waited for a full 30 min at the carousel from the first bag to my bag. Probably would not fly Etihad economy even with the lowest price. Seat pitch way too small for intl long hauls. AUH transit was not very pleasant with lines everywhere and terrible food options.                                                                                                                                                                                                                              1\n",

After 3 hours they changed the gate and got another plane - so an almost 4 hour delay.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         1\n",
      "We flew from Sydney to Las Vegas via Hawaii and return. We decided to treat ourselves to First class both ways which ended up a little disappointing to say the least. The seats did not recline very far (about the same recline as Qantas economy) and the food going over was just plonked in front of us in one hit. At least the staff coming back had a better idea of serving food. I have food allergies (which I notified the airlines of when we booked) and they said they'll see what they can do - all I can say was I was hungry when I arrived except for the food I took with me! Also the inflight entertainment was the same on all four legs so I was wishing I had brought a good book with me. The positives were the staff were friendly drink service was great and they boarded us quickly.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          1\n",
      "I had booked a ticket from Atlantic City to Chicago. The flight was supposed to leave at 4.49pm. However due to some scheduling issues the flight was rescheduled for 8pm. This was not done in one go but multiple times. It was first changed to 5.24pm then back to 4.49pm then 5.55 6.30 7.24 7.40 8pm. This threw our plans. There were three gate changes once we were in the airport. The flight we were supposed to travel came in at 7.02pm and we were all set to travel by 8. In another 15 minutes just before boarding we were told that the flight will again be delayed because the pilot had not arrived. We waited for another hour outside and half an hour in the plane before the pilot arrived. No proper explanations from the member of the staff. The plane took off at 9.28pm and reached Chicago at 10.45pm. We were 4.5 hours late. This is my second bad experience in a year.

      "I recently travelled on an Indigo flight from Delhi to Mumbai. My printed ticket stated that I was allowed to carry one checked in bag of 15 Kgs one cabin bag of 7 Kgs and in addition a laptop bag. However during check in I was asked to weigh all three pieces (suitcase cabin bag and laptop) and was told that the cabin baggage allowance was only a total of 7 Kgs which includes laptop bag shopping bags and cabin bag. So please note that if you decide to travel with Indigo airlines you are only allowed one suitcase of 15Kgs and all your cabin bags (laptop shopping bags and cabin bag) should not exceed 7 Kgs. Moreover what is printed on the ticket makes no difference to them.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     1\n",

      "Leeds-Bradford to Southampton plane was about half-full which seems fairly typical from the other reviews. Price was higher than Flybe but my employer paid . Everyone else also looked to be travelling on business - ie. no-one else would have been paying the fare themselves either. I suspect Eastern should be OK with the financial numbers if they can charge high amounts and half-fill the plane - this would be equivalent to quite a high loading (80%?) at Flybe prices. Flight itself was good helpful stewardess a very professional outfit. Excellent that they offer free Fast-Track at LBA - ideal for an early morning flight. Speaking of which they fly to Southampton earlier in the morning than Flybe which again is useful. It's also a really handy route Leeds to the south coast.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               1\n",
      "SHA (Hongqiao Apt) to TSN (Tianjin) on a relatively old 757-200 showing some signs of use. Economy class fully loaded. Takeoff with 2 hours delay due to late arrival of the plane from another location with dense fog. But the dedicated cabin crew handled everything with high efficiency. Food on this leg of 1h45min was standard but fully ok in every aspect. For the price I paid (early booking) I got an excellent value and thus can only express my satisfaction and recommendation.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            1\n",
      "This was my first time flying with them to Milan. The lounge at JFK was the smallest I've ever been to and unfortunately the amenities was minimal there and forget using the toilet I swear the toilets at Penn station was cleaner. I didn't think this flight experience was going to be better but I was very impressed with the level of efficiency it took the crew to help everyone to their seats and the flight took off on time. Service was excellent and the food was impressive for airline food. The new Magnifica cabin was clean and spacious. The new pods were very comfortable and each seat has a massager and sleeps flat. Suffice to say we were well pampered from beginning till the end of our flight which arrived 45 mins early.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  1\n",
      "Flew Prague to Luton with Wizz Air for the first time and unfortunately fell victim to large cabin baggage and therefore had to pay £60 to board with our luggage - which incidentally is small enough with respect to other non- frill flights with EasyJet and RyanAir. Please check their baggage limitations when purchasing tickets - the small baggage allowance included in the basic ticket price is limited to rucksacks and very small hand luggage. The plane we were on was old and had appalling leg room for the standard seats. I am only 5ft 10 and really struggled to get comfortable in any way. Fortunately the flight time was around 1.5 hrs although the flight was also delayed one hour. On-board staff were friendly and attentive. Flights were booked a month in advance and were fairly expensive at £190 per person.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           1\n",
      "Helsinki to Singapore Changi operated by Finnair although I booked with Air Berlin and I was disappointed. Check in was easy and service was good and polite. However the plane was in need of modernization or at least an update the leg room was small and for a 12 hour flight the choice of only four movies was inadequate. In fact I think I have had better inflight entertainment on board the flight from Malaga to Berlin on Air Berlin a mere 3 hour flight. The food however was perfectly acceptable and most definitely edible. However the drinks were infrequent. Served breakfast just before we were to land Singapore time 6pm meaning that when you got out of the plane you were ready for a whole day. Overall then I would not recommend.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            1\n",
      "The short flight from Athens to Istanbul was delayed by 1.5 hrs making my fiancé and I miss our connecting flights back to Singapore. We were stranded in Istanbul airport for 12 hours with no offer of food or drink and no concrete solution from Aegean. Eventually at 3am the morning we were given a hotel. We slept for 4 hours. We then rushed back to the airport the next morning finally guaranteed a flight and arrived back just in time for work on Monday 6am. We were suppose to be there the previous morning (Sunday). Aegean made no effort to book us decent seats leaving us to sit apart the entire journey home as a result I didn't sleep at all during the flight. Therefore I had 4 hours sleep in 48 hours and had to go straight in to work. The representative also lied to us to keep us happy until we left and could do nothing about it. We tried to call him but he refused to take our calls. The plane was really nice and comfy seats but the pilot nearly crashed upon landing. I would suspect that the reason the flight was delayed in the first place was that there was no pilot thus a stand-in pilot was used.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  1\n",
      "5/0/15 PHL-SLC Airbus A320. Flight similar to the ones I took on 5/4/15. Economy comfort is better than economy but not by much. Its main advantage is priority boarding which allows me to avoid the inevitable rush and scramble for overhead bin space. Rated food as 1 because I didn't buy any entertainment also as 1 because there wasn't any. I don't look forward to flying with Delta even in economy comfort.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     1\n",
      "Many people have had negative reviews about Delta domestic flights. I had no problem with them. Compared to International airlines I've flown they don't come close. But for domestic they were superb. Great FA's, clean plane, and on time service. The seats aren't too bad, and the inflight entertainment system was pretty good. Overall a nice flight and I would choose them again if I had the chance.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              1\n",
      "AMS-MEX-AMS. Seated in Economy Comfort. Very spacious leg room. Seat a bit narrow. The seat was very hard and was uncomfortable after a short time. From AMS food was good and tasty with good presentation. On the flight back the food was below acceptable with same side dish for both dinner and breakfast. Inflight entertainment fine without being extraordinary. Cabin service was fine but not extraordinary.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      1\n",
      "I decided to try them out because of their low airfare but only to find out about all these hidden fees! They charge you for just about everything checked bags carry-on bags seat assignments checking in at the counter and food and snacks onboard. All these things add up to the airfare so what's the point of even having the fare being that low? So if you really want to save money with them might as well fly empty handed (no bags) go hungryand thirsty and fly standing up (no assigned seats)! I just flew with them from Los Angeles to Houston on 10/10/14 and getting there was fine despite all these hidden fees and not getting any drinks or snacks. But on the returning flight to LA on 10/12/14 they kept announcing that the flight was being delayed due to weather. The plane could not land in Houston so it was diverted to Dallas. The weather was fine! The original departure time out of Houston was 4.46 pm and because the plane had landed in Dallas we had to wait for it to arrive in Houston. So they announced that it would be delayed until 5.26 and then 6.26 and then 6.56 and then 7.53. Finally after all this waiting they announced that the flight was cancelled! When they announced the flight cancellation we all had no choice but to rebook on another flight. After being in the long line to rebook they said the earliest available flight would not be until two days later! I decided that I had it with Spirit Airlines and took the refund. I will never fly with them again.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 1\n",
      "Flew MEL-MCY-MEL for a holiday on the Sunshine Coast. A computer problem at Tullamarine created long check-in queues but staff were checking to make sure waiting passengers did not miss departure deadlines and our flight left on time and arrived a tad early. Seating is a bit squashed but as to be expected from a budget carrier. Cabin crew were cheery and helpful. Didn't bother with the food. Return flight on time and uneventful. All in all value for the money.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             1\n",
      "Miami to Amsterdam and I found that the level of comfort was about what one expects these days. The flight attendants came by at regular intervals to offer free drinks and food was generous. One caveat was the in flight entertainment which costs 20 euros.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              1\n",
      "WAW-SKJ Economy. No free snacks or drinks on this Star Alliance partner. Just full legacy carrier fares for basically a budget airline. Flying out of Poland had no Euros or USD on me. I was thirsty and asked to purchase a bottle of water. The stewardess said that I could not buy it and could not use a credit card or purchase it in cash without their preferred currency. When I pointed out that they were able to sell duty free with visa cards she huffed and puffed and basically said it would be \"difficult\". She never offered me a tiny cup of water.

      "HKG-TPE both ways. Not a nice experience travelling with Dragonair. There was a passenger (an old lady) sitting beside me who had made an on-line request for a vegetarian food. However the flight attendants had missed her out. No apology was given to the lady but a rude flight attendant said: \"Are you sure you have made a special request online?\". The food is OK for both ways. Will still consider Dragonair if I do not have a tight schedule connecting other flights at HKIA but Dragonair will be definitely not my first choice.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           1\n",
      "Athens to Roma in Economy. Boarding was good but it turned rather bad once on-board. A women who decided that she wanted a window seat even though she did not have one just sat in one. This than created all kinds of drama. The mans seat who's this was asked her to move and she refused. He called a flight attendant and even she could not get her to move. She was glued to that seat and that was that. So the man had to move seats but he was with his wife and they wanted to seat together so all up 3 rows were shuffled to accommodate this women who wanted a window seat. Why the flight attendant just didn't move the original offender is beyond me. Once underway all was good. Short flight so no entertainment and a simple drink and nuts. Luggage was out quick in Roma.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           1\n",
      "Melbourne - Hong Kong - Frankfurt and return. Melbourne lounge dreadful - cramped viewless and poor food. Boarding chaotic especially in Hong Kong. Inflight service inconsistent - it seems business passengers are serviced last? The entire right hand side of the business class cabin was not offered bread during the meal service yet we all watched the basket being carried up and down the other aisle. Food not that good either - although of higher quality out of Melbourne and Frankfurt than Hong Kong. Requests for items (pillows drinks) required 2-3 times. They ran out of my preferred meal choice on both legs \"we did not expect Caucasians to order it\" said my flight attendant. Seat impossible to get comfortable on. I am only 172cm tall and 70kg but could not get a comfortable position. Odd padding sections on the seats and the very narrow foot well when sleeping filled me with regret that I had allowed myself to be talked into flying Cathay by my partner and not chosen to fly Singapore Airlines where you can stretch out and get proper service (in my view Singapore Airlines economy service is better than the Cathay business service).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  1\n",

What won me over however were the hospitable flight attendants. Smiling and courteous.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                1\n",
      "Aberdeen to Amsterdam and the service is high cost for what you get! Even if you don't book a fare that covers bags you need to pay for it.

      "TLV-JFK. Flight was overbooked and denied boarding even though we were on a tour. I understand this is a common occurrence and that Israelis are given preference over residence of other countries. El Al wanted to place us on standby even though there were seats in business and 1st class. EL AL wanted to place us on the 600am flight from TLV to Barcelona with transfer to AA plane to JFK. So instead of arriving 600am we would arrive 300pm with no sleep. Not acceptable. Wanted to purchase 1st class ticket EL Al did not want to sell. Finally convinced El AL to sell me the 1st class tickets. Once I became a paying passenger I guess a group ticket does not count as a paying passenger attitudes change and El AL became friendly. Flight was pleasant lots of space seats folded flat FA attentive. Unless you fly business or 1st class cannot recommend this airline.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             1\n",

Inflight services excellent.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     1\n",
      "We flew from Gatwick to Hurgada which was delayed by an hour because of a problem with the navigation equipment which was being looked at while we were sitting on the aircraft hoping it could be repaired. On the return journey half the passengers were returning to Gatwick the rest to Manchester. The flight was delayed 45 mins when we boarded. Then the aircraft had to stop at Paris to refuel. We sat there for an hour before the tanker arrived. On landing 2 hours late the poor Manchester passengers had to take their hand luggage get off the aircraft go through security then re board the same aircraft? We have flown with Monarch twice and both times it hasn't been a pleasant experience.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         1\n",
      "I just came home from a week in Ireland and flew US Air from Shannon to Philadelphia. After spending a week with friendly helpful smiling people in Ireland I encountered the least friendly rudest crew I have ever seen on any flight. The flight wasn't just Americans returning home but Irish people flying to America for maybe the first time. What a terrible impression they must have made! First of all they were a mess - they didn't even appear clean. No one said hello how are you etc. Food service (and the food) was terrible. Two of the women flight attendants were arguing in the aisle over the beverage cart about how to dispose of cans. I asked for a cup of tea with milk and sugar and got one milk. When I asked for another milk you would have thought I asked her for champagne. I swear I saw some of them roll their eyes at people. When we arrived we were welcomed to Philadelphia by \"your Philadelphia-based crew\" - what a bunch of miserable unhappy impolite people. They are all in the wrong profession. On the way off the aircraft no one said goodbye have a nice day or anything. It was my worst flight experience ever. US Airways needs to work on customer service. Another observation was at Philadelphia airport while sitting at the gate for my connecting flight.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                1\n",
      "Great round trip from PVG to SFO non-stop. On-time both ways (although I know this is not common for CEA). Plane was a new 330-200 with a well-equipped IFE. Very clean very nice. The flight was only about 40% full going to SFO and maybe 60% coming back. The stewardess told me that this was pretty normal for this flight maybe a combination of it being a new segment as well as the low season? I don't know but it was lovely. The regular economy seating seemed to have fairly spacious legroom but I didn't have to experience it since I was able to switch to the exit aisle on both flights. The gate attendant in PVG told me that there were no exit aisle seats available but they were clearly all empty when I got on the plane so I moved myself. On the way back the attendant in SFO was able to get me into an exit aisle seat with no fuss whatsoever and no additional fee either (looking at you US major airlines and your \"economy plus/economy comfort\" seat class). The Chinese on the flight preferred to try to get an entire empty row to themselves allowing them to lay down across the economy seats so there was no competition for the exit aisle seats. Service was friendly and polite (I speak Chinese so I can't comment on their language ability). Food was just average but not a deal breaker. Looking forward to taking this flight again. Also in SFO I was able to switch my return flight from SFO-PEK to SFO-PVG without any change fee since the original Beijing flight had me transferring in Shanghai anyway. Class! Can't imagine Delta letting you do that.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      1\n",

Flight crew did their best but as is becoming increasingly common these days it was fellow passengers who caused the biggest upset. Credit to QantasLink for handling the situation very well.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      1\n",
      "I live in DC but flew out of NYC to MNL and TPE via Incheon to take advantage of the lower fares offered out of JFK and to fly the A380 on the NYC route (vs 777 on flights to Dulles). I had flown EVA Air 777 JFK to TPE a few months prior and Y class seats on the Korean A380 definitely felt more spacious both in terms of pitch and seat width. And the more generous headroom on this aircraft was also noticeable. I also appreciated that the Korean lunch/dinner option (usually a pretty healthy bibimbap or some variation thereof) always came with soup and the snacks between meals - fruits chips chocolate hot ramen and/or hot sandwiches - were filling and tasty. The attendants treated customers with respect. Flight attendants were proactive helping parents with babies. I also thought the attendant uniform and the overall branding and color scheme of the airline were quite stylish and appealing. The AVOD movie selection was comparable to EVA but not as good as Cathay or Singapore. The only downside to the journey was the horrendously long and slow-moving check in line in Manila. Online check in was out of commission so I arrived at MNL a full three hours before the flight and completed check in with only 50 minutes to spare. But I suspect this had more to do with the poor infrastructure at this particular airport/terminal than Korean Air. Incheon is a wonderful airport for with lots of pleasing amenities for extended layovers so I would not hesitate to fly Korean (or Cathay for that matter) for future transpacific flights.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         1\n",
      "I had not flown CX for some time but was massively disappointed. 3 of the 4 business class flights (UK - Hong Kong - Singapore) were in seats that should have been scrapped years ago (747 especially). It was like travelling in an old coffin. The equipment was ancient I have not seen such poor seats and screens in other airlines for at least ten years. The screen at one time gave a message that Heathrow terminal 5 would be opening in March 2008 and that care should be taken when using Heathrow. This is amazingly poor. The food was more like economy standard than business. The choice of films and other entertainment was limited with very few recent films. The whole experience was not what I expect from a 'quality' airline. The only redeeming factor was that most of the staff were very helpful.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           1\n",
      "August 15-22 2013 EWR-LHR-DXB and return. First time on Virgin and a disappointment except for the stylish attitude. Economy all the way but tried an upgrade to Premium Economy on one return leg which they offered at a low price. Very mediocre entertainment system with limited selections movies on loops instead of on demand and surprisingly not many music choices- all with lots of rebooting and starting over. Way below Emirates and even other carriers. Food was small portions and poor which supported my policy to eat as little on planes as possible. Breakfast was like US Air very minimal. Tight seating in general last leg was far in the rear of Airbus with seat so narrow I was in hip pain for a week after. Premium Economy was very good in terms of seats same and entertainment. Upper class just one row ahead did not look inviting I see the point of the many comments. Travel agent chose this carrier for best price but everyone else is better.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   1\n",
      "Horrible food hot plane (and I feel the cold) seat didn't recline. No personal IFE had to watch a tiny screen at front of plane one movie wasn't in English. Didn't see staff much so couldn't get drinks. All flights delayed at both Auckland BA for 6 hrs each. Given measly meal voucher at BA that bought me nothing much. BA Airport was horrible and staff unhelpful. I had no personal effects for 24hrs once I arrived in Rio. I flew them to save $1000 over LAN Chile whom I will fly with next time and just spend the extra.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    1\n",
      "Vienna to Dulles in Business class. Superb in every respect. Others have been critical of the seating. I found the seats to be the best in the air. Yes they were firm but in a comfortable and supportive way. My next flight was on United business class and the softer seats were not nearly as comfortable as on Austrian. Food and service were outstanding. The hi-tech seat controls and audiovisual options were similarly good. In many rows the seating was 1-2-1 so plenty of options for privacy when traveling alone. Cathay Pacific was my previous all time favorite but Austrian is even better.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            1\n",
      "Last Monday (3/18/13) flight 1990 from SNA to SJC was 20 minutes late and this raised the possibility that the plane would not be able to take off before the 10pm airport curfew. The gate agent repeatedly motivated us to expedite our boarding. The flight took off before the curfew and the cabin crew provided their usual friendly service during flight. We arrived at SJC only 10 minutes behind schedule despite the late departure. For non-stop flights this airline remains my top choice for domestic flights.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                1\n",
      "26 June 2012. Flight Seoul Incheon - Bangkok. I travel at least 200'000 miles per year and always in business class with Star Alliance partners. This flight however was disappointing the plane an old 777 had old seats and the entertainment system was from the last century not what I expected from this airline. The staff was pleasant but the food was not up to standard.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          1\n",
      "I have just returned from a trip to Japan from Washington D.C. (DCA) to Tokyo Narita (NRT) on Air Canada flying DCA to YYZ to YVR to NRT. I returned from Tokyo Haneda (HND) via YYZ to DCA. Flight 1175 from YYZ to YVR was horrible - a 777 with 10-across cattle-car seating. Never again! Flight 3 from YVR to NRT was a great disappointment. Poor food (no taste and meagre portions) and a lacklustre cabin crew - lazy and not helpful. I had decided never to select Air Canada again (and was dreading the return flight) however Flight 6 from HND to YYZ (also a 777) had 9-across seating and a much better cabin crew. The ratings below reflect my AC006 experience AC1175 and AC003 would get poor ratings in virtually every category - even the Inflight Entertainment kept shutting off the map I was interested in watching.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             1\n",
      "We flew Guangzhou to Auckland on 30th June 2014 and found them to be professional and helpful. The seating on the A330-200 aircraft is very generous in Business Class. Pillows and blanket are of a good quality and seats comfortable for sleeping. The staff were excellent and did everything to try and make our flight as enjoyable as possible. Good food and beverage options - can highly recommend.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                1\n",
      "Malawi to Auckland and return via Cape Town. Unfortunately for SAA the Auckland to Perth sector was with code- share Air New Zealand - which was far superior in all respects. The SAA planes were relatively old and the seats were hard and uncomfortable. The cabin attendants were generally helpful but lacking in spontaneity. The food was bland and the in-flight entertainment was even blander. The air-map did not function at all. On the flight from Jo'burg to Cape Town our seat numbers were changed three times. We had deliberately booked a widow seat months in advance so that we could see the country from above but were changed at the last minute to middle seats. We then found that the rear economy section was almost empty. Cabin staff ignored the lowly cattle-class passengers and were busy reading the paper and chatting amongst themselves. We arrived in Cape Town but our luggage did not. SAA staff were not helpful in reuniting us and our bags. We were told that it would take 3 hours to get our bags to us but no calls were made to us even though we left our phone contacts. Finally after about 15 attempted phone calls we got our bags sent to us but no apology.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       1\n",
      "Flew LHR-CDG-SIN Business class. After having read the reviews on here I wasn't really sure what to expect - and was pleasantly surprised. The seat was very comfortable most so in a reclining position. When converted to bed was less so but none the less satisfactory. The service was really good very friendly and professional having recently taken Singapore Airlines on the same route I had low expectations. Food was lovely - quality good presentation and flavoursome. The IFE was not the best; difficult to navigate around cumbersome - however had some interesting films. Overall I would recommend them for long hall business. Very pleasant journey and very reasonably priced.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      1\n",
      "Stuck in Belize for 7 hours because the plane did not leave Houston. No further explanation on the matter except that the plane never left. The United staff that rescheduled our connecting flights was extremely rude and not helpful at all. It almost seemed as if she was taking joy in the fact that we were all stranded there. Then every passenger was forced to stay the night in Houston. My flight was supposed to be the first flight out of Houston leaving at 7am so I get to the airport at 5.30 am to find out that now it doesn't leave until 9:00. Every single staff me member I've encountered or asked for help from is miserable and rude. This was a one time thing but I will never ever fly United again. It's been the worst airline experience of my entire life and I've flown hundreds of times.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               1\n",
      "Feb 15 2014 I flew from ORD to LAX. The flight was the first one of the day. After 5 hours delay we boarded the plane and were told that a credit of $100 was going to be issued to us for a future reservation. I never received anything. I called Spirit and asked for the voucher number. Now the amount is $50! The customer service told me to call the airport and complain to them because the airport is responsible for issuing those vouchers. The customer service is terrible. Never again unless I really have no choice I rather spend more money than use Spirit again.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      1\n",

      "Flew on QF2 from Dubai to Sydney in Economy class. I had the option to get on Emirates EK417 too for the same price (departs after an hour QF2 departs) but took QF2 to reduce the transit time at Dubai and in the end regretted my decision. After making the booking Qantas changed the flight time which reduces the gap between the two flights just to 30 minutes. This was not a big issue however simply put the seat pitch and width made it one of the most uncomfortable long haul journey with my wife and two kids. EK417 seat pitch is 32-34 in with 18in width whereas QF2 seats were 17.5in wide with only 31in pitch hard to move in and out very painful with the front seats reclined. Besides that the service was better than Emirates (flew on Emirates Sydney-Dubai on the same trip). Emirates served meals thrice whereas on QF2 it was twice. Emirates had also an edge with onboard wifi. But in the end the seat pitch mattered the most.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        1\n",

      "Flight from Toronto to Amsterdam was delayed (4 hours). The $20 voucher that was given for the delayed was invalid throughout the airport and KLM staff was rude and refused an explanation when asked. Flight from Amsterdam to Toronto was once again delayed and the entertainment screen in approximately half of the seats (including mine) did not work. Not a good experience and will not travel again with KLM.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     1\n",
      "I have always received excellent service from Qantas. In particular I thoroughly enjoyed a recent A380 flight from Los Angeles to Melbourne. The flight attendants were friendly yet professional and the A380 was great too. I particularly loved the self-serve snack bar and in-flight entertainment on the A380 as well as how quiet the aircraft is. Despite flying in economy I managed to get a good rest on the overnight flight. The plane departed and arrived on time too. I had a good experience and wouldn't hesitate to recommend this airline.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               1\n",
      "I am waiting for my delayed flight out of Des Moines airport as I write this review. My husband and I have been here since 4.40 when check-in for the 6.51 flight opened. It is now almost 8pm. In the over 3 hours we have been here we have received two texts advising of delays. When we checked in we were advised of the first delay and later also heard over the airport PA that the flight had been delayed a second time. Our flight is now due to depart after 10pm for a 1.30 am arrival in Orlando. Around 7.00 we decided we should get some dinner since we were going to be up and in the air until the wee hours. So we visit every restaurant on the gate side of security to learn every single one closes their grill at 7pm. We go back to the gate and the only airport personnel we can find tells us they don't work for Allegiant and they cant help us. After talking to one of the cashiers we find out the restaurants on the other side of security are open until 8.30. So we get TSA's blessing and head out in search of food. After securing a meal my husband decides to visit the Allegiant ticket counter to complain. His point and mine is if you are going to delay flights until after the restaurants close you'd think they could let passengers know food wont be available. It's not like the passengers from out of state know anything about this small airport's business practices. Instead of nodding apologizing and offering some words of comfort the ticket agent asked for my husband's license. As my husband handed it over and told the agent he didn't want a free ticket or drink vouchers the agent said \"I'm not giving you anything free. I'm kicking you off the flight.\" My husband had to basically beg to be let back on the flight and was told if they heard any more comments or complaints about or from him he would not get on the plane. I assure you we will never fly Allegiant again!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            1\n",
      "Johannesburg to Bangkok return with a stopover. Was the worst flight experience I've ever had. Out of the 4 flights not a single one left on time. Staff were generally unfriendly and unhelpful. Addis airport is about as basic as they come. The inflight experience was dismal. Cant remember the movie played but I do remember the picture quality is awful and the audio is out of sync. On my return trip I was delayed by over 24 hours and we were booked into a hotel for the night. The hotel was the only good part of the experience. For the delay we were given a 300 dollar flight voucher which I will not use regardless how cheap the flight is. Terrible airline.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       1\n",
      "After getting to Vancouver airport for a 7am flight we were informed that our flight was delayed and we would be leaving at 3pm. So off to a friends place we went seeing as we don't live in Vancouver and have a 19 month old with us. Upon returning to the airport we were told that it was delayed again to 5.45 and they gave us a $20 food credit to make up for it. After we finished lunch we walked back into the airport and on the departure listing our flight was delayed again this time 7.40 pm so now we have been waiting for over 12hr and have lost a day from our holiday. I will never travel with them again.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         1\n",
      "I just completed an LGHW-BKK-LGW roundtrip on Phuket air and my feelings are mixed for sure - checkin was swift and I was immediately offered and exit seat - empty flight out so I actually had that exit row to myself - food delicious but quantities somewhat meagre and left me ravenous in midflight - I must echo the others by saying that the aircraft are not the most comfy and are really showing their age - the IFE is a mess. Staff not to be faulted. The check in agent at BKK lied to me for some reason telling me that I would certainly have 3 seats to myself as the flight was half empty [it was about 95% full in reality!] - the stop in Dubai makes the flight home almost intolerable as we cannot get off [that is at least 15 or 16 hours in that thing!]                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      1\n",
      "Flew to Singapore and returned from Bangkok via Brunei. I didn't know what to expect as previous to this I had never heard of Royal Brunei. I found that economy was surprisingly spacious. Flights both ways were not full so had a spare seat next to me. Meals on board were more than enough however as I am a big eater the flight attendants were more than happy to accommodate this. The stopover in Brunei was only 45 minutes so the actual time spent doing nothing was about 15 minutes. The only problem if I had to pick on was the small screen sizes but in the end it didn't really bother me. Would definitely fly again.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  1\n",
      "HKG-TPE-HKG my first time on CX but if these 2 flights are the norm then it won't be my last CX406 and CX405 on a 773 and returning on an A330. Check in both at HK Central and TPE quick and polite the lounges both in HK and TPE very good too. The flights for a flight of 1hr 30min where fantastic they really put the US and European airlines regional business class to shame the seats were great the new type out and the old type back. The crew again very friendly and really on top of their game then the food I don't bother that much with airline food but this again was pretty good. Great trip and I will be looking to use CX again soon on there long haul product.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  1\n",
      "Travelled Sydney - London and return on QF1/2 in Premium Economy. Believe it was worth the sale price we obtained the tickets for but not the normal full price. The cabin service was excellent as we're the meals and entertainment system. The only downside of the trip was a late return into Sydney resulting in a missed connection. We were told we would be on the next flight but at domestic transfer we were told our domestic booking had not been changed and as there were no seats on the next flight we have to weight another hour for the flight after.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   1\n",
      "Flew IXE-DXB on a B737-800 with winglets. Extremely delighted with surprise upgrade to business class by the airline staff. Enjoyed the flight with good recliner seats & extra leg room. Food quality just remains lagging compared with Air India.

      "We had reservations on Island Air from Kauai to Honolulu. We would have had 2.5 hours to catch our connecting flight from Honolulu to Spokane on Allegiant. Island Air cancelled the flight due to weather. The next flight an hour later was cancelled due to mechanical issues. They had no other flights that would get us to our connecting flight on time. Island Air could not re-schedule our flight on another airline until they could confirm Allegiant's take off time. Allegiant only flies out of Honolulu once a week so if you miss the flight you're out of luck. They were putting people on Hawaiian Airlines so they could meet connecting flights but couldn't figure out how to do if for us. They told us we were not priority! We spent 15 hours in the Kauai airport before getting a flight back to Spokane (on Alaska). We will never fly Island Air again.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        1\n",
      "Done all necessary procedure to make sure my girl would get proper assistance as she has special needs. When she got to Toronto, no wheelchair was brought to her even though AC confirmed that she would have her own at the door for the leg at the next terminal. She had to walk to the gate and no one offered help! She has cerebral palsy and walks with difficulty and very slowly. Nobody at AC wondered if the only passenger with a wheelchair had the proper service.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            1\n",
      "I fly CI for my annual trip to Bangkok from Calgary. It's an interline route using Westjet from YYC to YVR and China Airlines for YVR-TPE-BKK and return. They continue to use the old tired A343 for YVR-TPE lag which is showing its age although preferable to me due to the 2-4-2 configuration as I tend to pick a window seat. I am finding their service is going downhill over the last four years especially for inflight entertainment and the meal. The meal from YVR was stale and inedible so is the breakfast on the TPE-BKK and TPE-YVR leg. Brand new B777-300ER for TPE-BKK which had great cabin and IFE interface. Fair value for money but service could be a lot better for the money.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  1\n",
      "LHR-DFW-SJO return via JFK. I set out with middling expectations of AA in economy and was pleasantly surprised. New 777 is great seats a little narrow but what can you expect? Flights to and from SJO on old 757s but crew made both flights quite enjoyable. If only JKF immigration would work a little better. Everyone's experiences are always different but on this occasion AA looked after us nicely.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              1\n",
      "My husband and I recently flew from Sydney to Bangkok with Qantas. It is many years since we have flown with this carrier usually flying with Emirates which we consider to have superior service. It was interesting for us to conclude at the end of the Qantas trip that our opinion has not changed unfortunately. The attendants on Emirates are in our opinion more obliging more approachable and must I say a lot younger maybe explaining their increased enthusiasm for their job. This is an observation that we could not help but notice. At the end of the day customer service should be the main priority of these employees and if the enthusiasm and motivation to deliver this service has waned the company has a problem. Flight attendants are the face of the company and can spoil the customer's experience if service is not delivered in an obliging friendly manner.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             1\n",
      "I fly on Sun Country on a somewhat regular basis and try to fly them whenever possible. On my latest flight to San Diego from MSP everything went very smoothly. The staff are very attentive and accommodating. The only things that are less than perfect was the seat condition which was a little worn and the in-flight entertainment is a Digi-Player instead of a seatback screen. Other than that they are my hometown airline.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      1\n",
      "MIA-BCN changing in Madrid. Knew before flight that it would depart 2.5 hrs late (late incoming flight). Flight itself was smooth (but of course 2.5 hrs late). We were told not to collect our luggage in MAD there was only one harassed and exceedingly slow-moving Air Europa clerk dealing with things. Changed us to a SpanAir flight that we couldn't possibly make had to go back and be assigned a later flight. Of course luggage was nowhere to be seen it finally arrived 3 days later in Barcelona. Staff I dealt with were indifferent. They knew we would miss connecting flight and did nothing about it to prevent days worth of trouble later.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             1\n",
      "OR JNB to JFK. Airbus A346. Equipment was spotlessly clean and attendants were quite attentive. The food was as good as airline food can be perhaps a little better. Seats were very comfortable. The flight on time. Check-in was done expeditiously and personnel were efficient. I feel that this is an above-average airline and would not hesitate to fly SAA again.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    1\n",
      "Got a wonderful cheap fare from London City to Florence £56 each way! London City a delight to travel through except when your flight is badly delayed which sadly ours was. No announcements made to tell anyone what was happening 2 hour delay shown on the departure board popped up at boarding time. Actually a BA fan but this was handled very badly. No information or assistance. Then when we boarded we were delayed by another hour thankfully once on board the cabin crew and pilots were great at communicating and almost made up for the bad handling by ground staff. Great hot breakfast and drinks served on board on the way out. The return flight was on time and again a lovely crew and a very acceptable snack and drink service. Excellent value compared to the \"low cost\" carriers no extra charges for bags etc allowed and free drinks if you wanted them. Apart from the delay outbound a wonderful trip. Would have been a 10/10 had we left on time.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      1\n",
      "Almost missed my father's funeral in Poland because of this airline. LOT was the only airline that made its passengers come to O'Hare on Feburary 1st day of the huge blizzard in Chicago in anticipation that our flight which was scheduled to depart at 9:55 pm would depart. After hours of waiting at the terminal they boarded us on the plane and made us wait until midnight to tell us our flight was cancelled. We were stuck at the airport because the blizzard became so bad that no taxis were running. The only bus running was in between the terminals. LOT gave nothing - not even a blanket to keep warm with. No transportation from the airport no hotel not even a cot and a blanket. ORD-WAW delayed over 2 hours which made me late for my connecting flight from WAW-KRK. Told me on the plane the flight was waiting for me and everyone else who had that flight - turns out they are liars. The plane never waited. Scheduled us for a later flight which was late by 2 hours. On the way home same thing delays delays. Unless you want to be stressed angry and late I recommend taking a different airline. The cheaper price is not worth it.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                1\n",
      "I had very high expectations for Asiana but I didn't see them. Flew from JFK-ICN-HAN. Crew is great and they have a tough job keeping up with a lot of high maintenance passengers. Korean meals are good western meals are not. On the ICN-JFK leg dinner is served after take off and nothing else for 11 hrs. If you ask you can get a bag of potato chips. Leg room is ok on the 777 but really didn't feel like 34 inches and width is narrow. AVOD works well but the choices are limited. The 777 is also poorly designed without enough toilets so there is always a line for the two in the centre. The seat belt sign was only partially enforced and even during heavy turbulence when the crew was told to be seated there was still people walking around. Upon landing at JFK no fewer than four people got out of their seats during taxiing and had to be told to sit down. The A330 was more comfortable particularly from HAN-ICN which was completely empty and everyone had their own row. There is also an obsession with duty free and for the last three hours of the first leg the entire crew was consumed with taking and delivering orders. Having said all that Asiana is still miles ahead of AA Delta United etc.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              1\n",
      "Flew from Oslo to London. Check in and Seat Booking can be done on the net but only 22 hours before flying would be better if you could book your seat at the point of booking your flight. We managed to check in on the intent while we were in the hotel in Oslo. When we got to the airport to print our boarding passes the machines seem to all not really work we managed to spot a staff who helped us out by printing the boarding pass for us. We got to our gate and then had to wait communication was poor we were told that there was a delay to the flight only 15mins or so before the flight was supposed to take off staff were there earlier so I don't understand why this was not communicated earlier. Also they asked those with tickets numbers towards the back of the plane to board first however they did not seem to actually manage the situation if someone from the front row did board all the same so it did seem like only half a process was followed. Compared to Silk Air which does short haul flights around Asia this was a poor service compared to Easyjet and Ryanair this was a better service at least they bothered to clean the cabin a little before we boarded.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            1\n",
      "I recently flew on the MAA-DEL-SYD leg. At Chennai airport for an A320 flight they had only 3 operating check-in counters whilst planes from other airlines had 5-6 counters. This led to long delays and lengthy queues. The Air India ground staff at New Delhi airport seemed to be helpful in helping the passengers getting to their connecting flights. The Dreamliner for the Delhi - Sydney leg seemed to be a good one. The flight was delayed by 3 hours due to 3 stewards reporting sick at the last moment and they had to bring in replacement crew. The announcements were spotty and not easily forthcoming. The food served was tiny in portion with only one round of drinks offered for a 12.5 hour journey. The IFE was limited but worked. The toilets didn't have any amenities for a long-haul flight. The punctuality and the unreliability of this airline would make one say never again.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           1\n",

I highly recommended flying with Cathay.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        1\n",
      "My husband and I travelled from Bristol to Paphos Cyprus last September. Aircraft seats were very cramped with little legroom. Return flight was a nightmare. Halfway through the flight the captain announced that the aircraft was being diverted to Cardiff due to \"operations systems\". The plane was needed at Cardiff to return to Cyprus. We were then coached back to Bristol adding nearly 3 hours to our journey. We have since learned that these diversions are a regular occurrence with Thomas Cook flights. This is the last time we will ever use Thomas Cook.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               1\n",
      "LHR-RUH return. That was my first and hopefully last journey with bmi. The seat was uncomfortable small and very hard to control. The crow didn't provide enough pillows and blankets especially inbound and when we ask them they just say sorry we don't have any more. The crew were unfriendly just drop the meal on your table and when ask them for a bottle of water they found another bottle besides me and they said you already have one. I asked them for some ice and they said it's not in my trolley at the moment sorry! My entertainment system was broken outbound. If it was cheaper I would accept their behaviour but unfortunately it's one of the most expensive airlines to middle east.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             1\n",
      "QF10 for LHR-DXB connecting to EK380 from DXB-HKG. For the second part of my flight the Emirates A380 experience is just slightly overrated. To start with you could tell that some of the cabin crew were experienced and some were just very new to their job one tried to help a passenger climb over two seats for a toilet run during meal service but were quite clumsy when she dropped the tray of food entirely spilling everything on the aisle. Nevertheless it was evident that the cabin crew tried very hard to impress. What was annoying was the amount of commercials they had on their video screens - other airlines just have safety demonstration videos prior to takeoff but theirs include videos on Dubai the ICE entertainment and skyawards which was slightly unnecessary. The food quality wasn't as good as what was offered aboard Qantas but was still satisfactory. Even if Emirates have been praised over and over again I think it still needs to improve its service consistency and still is not in the same league with airlines such as CX and SQ.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    1\n",
      "DUS-EWR. Lufthansa has improved many things in the past which was also more than necessary nothing to complain on this flight crew was also unusual friendly.

      "QF 494 / 489 MEL-SYD-MEL on 10/01/14 - 12/01/14. 21.00 Flight from Melbourne on an old 767 (no seatback IFE) boarded early but was probably only 30% booked. Roared out of Tullamarine ten minutes before scheduled departure time with the captain announcing that the plane had been given an early landing slot at Sydney and we were going to get there as quick as possible. Captain announced that this was the aircraft's last commercial flight with Qantas. Flight crew were cheerful and offered beer and wine on the flight. offering everyone a second round as the cabin was lightly booked. 20.30 Flight back was pleasant however service was somewhat more contrite and being a weekend flight alcoholic refreshments were not complimentary. Aircraft was an equally dated 767 which had been refitted but still looked tired although the flight back contained the iPad streaming IFE which works well. Otherwise an overall pleasant experience. Flights were booked months in advance extremely cheap during a sale.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    1\n",
      "Some 5 flights within couple months. Most of the time I have no trouble with them. Planes are clean and ok condition. Seat pitch also ok. Bags arrive promptly. Food is mediocre and tasteless. Most flights early or on schedule. The only exception to the rule was my flight from Gatwick to Kiev. During the last snowfall when Gatwick was closed before 4pm our flight scheduled to depart around 1030 am was delayed by 15 hours. No clear information from the staff (they use third party handling company in London) no food vouchers no dinner no accomodation - nothing at all. They offer low cost quality service plus free baggage allowance and that is it. If the price is right it can be accepted as is.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  1\n",
      "Recently flew several long international flights with United from Chicago to Tokyo and back. For a 12 hour flight there was no inflight entertainment no seatback TV and they not charge money for drinks. I would argue that United is well below the average. The flight attendants do the bare minimum and nothing more. I will not fly on United again.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  1\n",
      "Took family on trip from Chicago to Las Vegas. Arrived at O'Hare Ticket counter 1 hour prior to departure. Took 15 minutes to go through line and complete auto-ticketing system. At end of check in screen flashed \"Unable to complete check-in.\" Went to agent about message when she loudly stated \"You're too late. You should have arrived earlier. We might get you on the next flight (3 hours later).\" Nowhere did it state on their web-site that you would not be able to board your flight unless you arrived at ticket counter at least 1 hour prior to flight. We were in line at least 60 minutes prior to flight, and completed automated process 45 minutes prior. At least 15 others not allowed to board. Staff at Phoenix were friendly and apologetic. Ironically we were warned not to fly with US Air by a frequent business flyer but thought, how bad could it be?

      "DAL to LIT. Recently flew Am Eagle from Dallas to Little Rock. When I got on the plane the senior citizen next to me asked the stewardess where the restroom was located. The stewardess rudely stated that \"they announced at the gate that the restroom is broken and you should go before you get on the plane.\" When we informed her that neither of us heard the annoucement she just stared. Then she said \"well it is just a short flight so it is okay-only 53 minutes.\" I tried to explain that for us senior citizens that it is not okay and she just walked away. I mean come on. Can't they even maintain the restrooms? And to make matters worse I complained to American Airlines and have yet to get a response. Poor maintenance issues late flights and rude agents in the past made me start to doubt the airline and this is just the frosting on the cake!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             1\n",
      "Dec 22 2014. JFK-VIE Boeing 777. Economy class is 10 seats across 3x4x3. Very tight seating and uncomfortable. I had an aisle seat and was constantly getting bumped by people in the aisle. Food was pretty good and the in flight entertainment was pretty complete with some up to date movies. The flight crew was pleasant and professional. Boarding was very disorganized with many people carrying oversize baggage. overhead space was overloaded. All in all it was a flight you endured not enjoyed.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              1\n",
      "I am sitting in the boarding area as I write this review. Spirit has succeeded in overbooking a flight to Tampa for the Easter weekend. My family purchased these tickets last August (2014). We had hoped to have a great Spring Break with the kids. Now my family of 4 is being bumped to tomorrow. This is unbelievable and unacceptable. I would never ever fly with them again.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        1\n",
      "Berlin-Tenerife South. Flight on time new-looking but very dirty B737-800 - rubbish left everywhere seatbelts not folded some old papers and cups on the floor seat pockets etc. Full flight so no food left for purchase after few first rows just a drinks and some expensive sweets even though flight was almost 5 hours. Crew was simply doing their job but no smiles no interaction with passengers. Free WIFI which is amazing kept me busy for duration of the journey otherwise - typical low cost with not much expectations.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     1\n",
      "BOG-MED-BOG in economy class. Flights late both ways with no explanation. No announcements in English only Spanish so you just have to follow the crowd. Inflight service is virtually non existant with the exception of lousy coffee. For a Country that exports some of the best coffee in the world Avianca serves the sludge. Shame as the flight attendants look good in their uniforms but that is where it ends.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     1\n",
      "March 20th 2015. Flight 7001 from Miami International to Rome via Dusseldorf. The boarding started around 3.15pm. After several hours inside the plane we were informed by the captain that they were trying to fix a \"leak\". After two more hours we were instructed to disembark the aircraft with our carry on and wait inside the terminal. Neither water or any type of food or snacks were offered by Air Berlin employees. Early evening we were told to board the aircraft again with all our belongings to our incredible surprise we stayed inside the plane again for more than two hours. Finally the captain informed the passengers that now the aircraft was having computer \"issues\" and we would have to sleep in Miami without any hint as to when the next plane will be ready for us to continue to Dusseldorf. Early next morning I went to Air Berlin counter just to find chaos and indifference to all passengers from the day before. The employees did not know when the next plane will be departing so I run to American Airlines who provided me with connections to Rome.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      1\n",
      "I have traveled with US Airways many times as I live in Asheville NC and the closest major airports are CLT and ATL. Therefore whenever I travel I almost only fly Delta or US Airways. Most recently I flew from CLT to CUN. Although the 757-200 had winglets and the fancy new AA paint job that could not make up for the dissatisfaction I experienced during flight. My seat was very uncomfortable and the cabin was very very dated. There was NO in flight entertainment (not even from the clunky overhead screen). The staff were decent but nothing spectacular. On the way back I flew on an A321 but it felt similar to the 757 I had flown on to CUN. I have flown on every type of plane in the fleet and every plane has this sort of feeling with the exception of the A330 (note: the A330 fleet still feels average when compared to other airlines but is better than every other plane in their fleet. The 767-200s in their fleet are horrible and the A320 family in their fleet is relatively shabby. Regional jets are what you would expect from a regional jet. Overall a horrible airline and as soon as I move out of Asheville to a larger city I plan on using another airline.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              1\n",

      "Flight from Birmingham to Cancun on Dreamliner. The most uncomfortable flight myself and wife have ever been on. My wife being under 5feet ended up with a bad neck due to the poor seat design and swollen feet as the edge of the seat cut off the blood supply. A foot rest would have prevented this. The food was the worst ever any on the return flight was inedible.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 1\n",
      "A320 flight Sharjah-Yanbu (Saudi Arabia) on 16 Sept. Great flight. Check-in was easy and agent offered me a pass to the Biz Lounge for AED 100 with food wifi drinks. Lounge was nice but wifi didn't work - not a big deal. Flight boarded via bus so nice to walk up the plane. Flight attendants very friendly - speaking 8 languages so very diverse. Safety video is the best ever! All done with children so you really want to watch and pay attention. Ordered a turkey sandwich which was large and very tasty. Smooth flight and landed 10 min early. Really enjoyed the airline and flight.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       1\n",
      "CPH-BKK-DPS-BKK-KIX. All flights except BKK-KIX in Business with the last sector in First. Elegant service on all legs and the gentle attention to detail was consistent across all the flights. I first flew TG in 1966 and that impression has held up for decades. The food is tasty and beautifully presented and the staff - from beginning to end was delightful. With more than 40 years of travel with them I remain a huge fan.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     1\n",
      "I took an intercontinental return flight from Madrid to Havana. It was a daytime flight and except from the comfort of the seat this was an incredibly bad experience. The service was by far the worst service I've had in an airplane. The crew were very unfriendly and not co-operative at all. With dinner you'll get 1 drink. Apart from water or orange juice you have to buy all other drinks. The crew started serving food at a slow pace afterwards they came 3 times with coffee/tea and immediately afterwards the whole crew started to have dinner themselves. The stewards/stewardesses also didn't respond at all to the service lights you can switch on at you seat. I don't expect much from airplane food but this was one of the worst I've had. Air Europa also doesn't provide a personal entertainment system. It is still done by some general screens from the ceiling and was only broadcasting a movie in Spanish. Worst of all the movie was restarted 3 times and wasn't finished in the end. On the return way we had to wait an 1.5 hrs to get checked in. There was an enormous queue all the way through the departure hall. About half of the passengers still had to check in after us. So we asked for window seats (25% of the seats). We were told these weren't available anymore. So we asked for Aisle seats (50% of the seats). The ground stewardess told us she would fix this. In the end from the 10 people we were traveling with only 1 had an aisle seat and the rest were scattered through the whole plane on centre seats. Luckily this was a night flight and we were all tired. So we slept most of the way and didnt have to deal with the service or Spanish movie. The food was of the same standard again: really bad.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           1\n",
      "Laung Prabang-Bangkok. At first I was a bit apprehensive about flying on a local Asian airline. I soon discovered that the service and standard were far superior to most European short haul airlines. The flight departed and arrived on time in difficult conditions. Access to the airport lounge in Luang Prabang was included. The lounge was quite basic but appreciated with a free snack and refreshment. The in flight cabin on the ATR72 was quiet small but comfortable. The food served on board was excellent. I highly recommend this airline.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                1\n",
      "Flew London to Philadelphia then on to Greensboro NC and return. Outbound the first leg was excellent. The connecting flight to PTI was delayed as there was no fuel in the aircraft then an engine failed on start up. The Captain kept us informed as the engineers tried to fix it and an hour later we boarded a replacement airframe. On the return there was an hour delay at Philadelphia due to the aircraft being \"too hot in the cabin\" as it had been sat in the sun all day but the staff kept us informed of progress. What I did appreciate was that the bags went straight through and were ready to collect straight away. There is always room for improvement but I think these guys should focus a bit more on the maintenance - get the aircraft ready earlier and make sure it is serviceable before the flight - not wait until everyone is at the gate waiting to board.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              1\n",
      "15 hour delay in Regina Airport. Flight was supposed to leave at 7.45pm delayed to 9pm then 11pm then 2 am then at 2.30 am they announce that it would be delayed until 10 am but to be at the airport at 7 am. They stated they would pay for hotel rooms and taxi. Another hour wasted waiting in line to be told what hotel and waiting for taxi service. At the hotel the manager tells the crowd that Sunwing has no account with the hotel so we waited for taxi to go back to airport it was now 4.30 in the morning so we slept in the airport. 10 am rolls along and we are told our flight is leaving on time but will have to go to Toronto instead of a direct flight to Varadero. I understand delays and weather conditions but this was over the top. Spend the extra and fly with a more reputable company.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  1\n",
